  AIDS ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ) is a condition caused by a virus called HIV ( Human Immuno Deficiency Virus ) . This virus affects the body 's defence system so that it can not fight infection . How is infection transmitted ? through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner . through infected blood or blood products . from an infected mother to her baby . It is not transmitted from : giving blood/ mosquito bites/ toilet seats/ kissing/ from normal day-to-day contact How does it affect you ? The medical aspects can be cancer , pneumonia , sudden blindness , dementia , dramatic weight loss or any combination of these . Often infected people are rejected by family and friends , leaving them to face this chronic condition alone . Did you know ? there is no vaccine or cure currently available . 10 million people worldwide are infected with HIV . you can be infected for between 10-15 years without realising it . 7 out of 10 people infected are heterosexual . women are twice as at risk from infection as men . In the UK 16,000 reported infections ( it is probable that there are between 40-60,000 people actually infected ) . there are nearly 5,000 reported cases of AIDS , of which nearly 3,000 have already died . 1 in 500 Londoners are believed to be infected . The Future The World Health Organisation projects 40 million infections by the year 2000 . " We are just at the beginning of the worldwide epidemic and the situation is still very unstable . The major impact is yet to come . " -- Professor Jonathan Mann , former director of the WHO Global AIDS Programme and ACET 's International Adviser .

ACET volunteers work as part of a team and provide help in many different ways to ensure that people do n't spend time in hospital unnecessarily . What do ACET volunteers do ? Transport clients to and from hospital Housework Shopping including collection of prescriptions Daysitting and nightsitting How much time to I need to give ? The simple answer is as much or as little as you feel able to give . Many of our existing volunteers have families and jobs and are often very busy . You do n't have to make a firm commitment but obviously we like you to give us some idea of your availability . This is so we can respond effectively to the needs of our clients . Do I need any training ? Yes -- but you are not expected to be a nurse . You will be asked to complete an application form and subsequently to attend an ACET training course one evening a week for six weeks . The subjects covered will include : Death and Dying Grief and Loss Sex and Sexuality Medical Aspects of HIV/ AIDS Race and Racism Practical Issues What if I find certain issues or situations difficult ? Your course leader will be available to help you . You are also asked to keep your church leaders informed of your involvement so that they can ensure you are adequately supported . After every client visit you are asked to call the office so that you can report how the visit went . We also hold regular meetings of volunteers to discuss issues of concern and encourage one another . Volunteers visiting an ACET client have immediate access to professional nursing support through our 24 hour on call facility . I would like to be an ACET volunteer so what do I do now ? Telephone or write to Christine Catlin or Janet Sutton and ask for an application form . ACET P O Box 1323 London W5 5TF Tel : 081 840 7879 Newsletter AIDS CARE , EDUCATION AND TRAINING Issue No. 7 Cliff is New Patron CLIFF RICHARD and Head of Salvation Army , General Eva Burrows are the first patrons of ACET . In the charity 's Ealing offices , Cliff , with BBC newsroom South East television cameras in attendance , cut a cake to help celebrate ACET 's third birthday during June . After a short interview with the BBC , Cliff went to meet ACET client Tony Chapman at his home , together with HIV Community Nurse , Sue Lore . A trip to an ACET AIDS education class at Abbeylands School , Addlestone in Surrey , completed Cliff 's visit . Cliff said , " I am pleased to support ACET in the world they are doing . The care of people in the community , with are ill with HIV infection and AIDS , together with the education of schoolchildren to help prevent the spread of this terrible disease is becoming more and more urgent . " " I believe it is especially important that ACET represents the Church working in the front line to provide real and practical support . So often Christians are criticised for not getting involved . " Cliff with Dr Patrick Dixon , Director of ACET Glasgow Home Care ACET opened its Glasgow Home Care service in late June after receiving confirmation of a grant from the Greater Glasgow Health Board to fund the work . The Ruchill Hospital Social work team and the AIDS Resource Unit were particularly helpful in identifying the need for this service . Home care Coordinator , Margaret Gillies , currently has a team of 20 volunteers from a variety of churches providing practical help to a number of clients already referred . Strathclyde Regional Council may provide further funding and consideration is being given to the possible employment of a part-time nurse . Margaret Gillies says , " We are discovering the extent of the need for the kind of help that ACET offers from other support agencies including Scottish AIDS Monitor and Body Positive as well as hospital contacts and local counselling services . " Chris Southwick , director of ACET ( Scotland ) , said , " With the opening of this office in Glasgow , ACET 's volunteer home care is now available to 95 % of those infected with the HIV virus in Scotland . " Most Churches Unprepared for Aids " Most churches are completely unprepared for the shock of finding an established member of the congregation is infected with HIV or dying with AIDS , even though this is increasingly common . " ACET Director , Dr Patrick Dixon , recently told the National Symposium on Teenage Sexuality at Swanwick . The conference was attended by 300 church youth leaders and school workers from across the UK . Dr Dixon said , " With up to 20 years from infection to illness , we just have to ask how many of our congregation have been added during that time ? Three-quarters of the AIDS problem is in London and much of the rest in Scottish cities . Churches in these areas particularly need to be informed , involved in community care and supporting Christian workers seeking to prevent new HIV infection in schools . " The Symposium considered how the Church can communicate more effectively to young people today for the benefit of their safety and emotional health . " Many churches are responding . Those involved with ACET are now helping provide home care for one in four of all those dying with AIDS in the UK and up to 4,000 school pupils a month are now receiving education on the subject . Both programmes are the largest of their kind in the country . " ACET is currently offering speakers to inform , motivate , train and support . Churches wanting a speaker should contact the West London offices on 081 840 7879 . Third Annual Report Published The third annual report for 1990/ 91 , subtitled " Bringing it Home " was published on 21 June this year . Official figures suggest that ACET provided care at home for up to one in four of all those who died of AIDS in the UK last year . 24,000 pupils were also seen by ACET educators . Bulletin Board ACET will shortly be opening a new office in the east end of London to serve clients in North and East London . Nurse Kay Hopps will have responsibility for the running of the office . The numbers of men , women and children covered by home care with 24 hour on call has doubled in a year . ACET South ( based in Portsmouth ) will move into its new accommodation during July . Purchased by the Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Area Health Authority , the building will be home to two other AIDS charities . The team is caring for growing numbers ill on the South Coast , including Brighton . The 24-page full colour schools booklet " HIV -- It 's Your Choice " is now available to members of the public at a price of 50p each . Last year ACET educators saw 24,500 pupils in face to face presentations . The ACET Conference in May at the Ealing YMCA was well attended by both staff and volunteers from London , the South East , Northern Ireland , Scotland , Romania and Uganda . UK Director and organiser of the Conference , Peter Johnson , said , " For many , the day provided a reaffirmation of the vision for ACET and a marvellous sense of unity . It was the first time our national and international network had gathered together in one place and made us all realise just how much the work has grown . " Three visitors from Frankfurt , Germany , recently visited ACET 's offices before returning home to begin a similar service , Christian AIDS Help ( CAH ) . Interest was expressed in all of the organisational aspects of home care including nursing , equipment loans and the volunteer programme . Like ACET , CAH will give both medical and practical help to AIDS patients in the home . Letters to the Editor Letters would be welcome . Any contributions may be edited .

Be an ACET-Link for your Church Dear Friend As the number of people ill with AIDS increases so does the need for volunteers to care for them . Over the last three years , our volunteers have provided much love and care to many hurt and lonely people . The support our volunteers provide can not be measured in purely practical terms and their continuing contribution is vital if we are to provide an ongoing service . In recognition of their importance and the need to train more volunteers , we want to develop links with individual churches . To do this , we would like to recruit people who are willing to be an ACET-link in their church . An ACET-link person , possibly an existing volunteer , would keep their church informed about our work and encourage people to consider becoming volunteers , help with fundraising ideas and circulate newsletters . An ACET-link will play a vital role as our work is growing so rapidly . If you would like to know more about being an ACET-link , please contact Chris Catlin/ Peter Glover on 081 840 7879 or write to ACET , PO Box 1323 , LONDON W5 5TF . Peter Johnson UK Director Tear Fund Support Ugandan Work Anthony Kasozi 's work as ACET 's Director in uganda has recently received financial support form Tear Fund which has enabled him , together with ACET General Manager , Maurice Adams , to identify a number of church-based projects for the coming year . These include : pedal cycles for a clinic allowing nurses to get out to outlying villages ; health care kits to help with the care of patients in their own homes ; training for different agencies ; and a variety of education initiatives . Returning from a visit to Uganda , where he met with patients in the villages and with other agencies , Maurice Adams said , " It is a beautiful country which is being devastated by a disease which can be stopped . " " The population in general is very well educated about AIDS , " says Anthony Kasozi , " thanks to the commitment of the Ugandan Government who have done well in raising awareness . The need here is to convince people that they must change their behaviour . We are seeking to find out what local people want , because they must own the work themselves . In this way , with a little money but much commitment , a great deal can be done . " HIV Community Nurse , Sue Lore , takes an education class with the help of patron , Cliff Patron . Living with AIDS by John Creedy You can be perfectly well with HIV and at other times chronic debility makes it hard to do even the basic things . In the early days the stigma of being HIV positive had driven away about 60 % of my circle of friends . Despite the publicity giving the facts surrounding the transmission of the disease , ignorance was such that they became afraid of normal social contact . It soon became clear that I could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores like shopping and housework when I needed it . While deciding to stay as independent as possible , I contacted ACET who I knew provided practical care at home . I had previously spent about two years asking local social services and friends for help and not having it happen , so my flat had become pretty run down . There was also the question of my own exhaustion . Even a weekly visit by a local authority home help -- when it was finally arranged -- was not enough . Help provided by ACET volunteers eventually go the flat ship-shape again and life became easier . Illnesses , including chronic muscle debility , herpes , tremors and eye infections , have come and gone . Recently I have experienced serious and potentially fatal fevers . Basically every day is an effort , that 's the reality , and there 's a great tendency to want life to be as it was . I have far fewer friends and I am partially sighted , which makes me a lot more vulnerable ; but whatever happens physically , I have always said that it was what happened mentally that mattered . Being aware of the stress and pressure that many people and their families experience when AIDS or HIV is first diagnosed , I became involved in counselling . I have also campaigned for the Government to give AIDS greater recognition , not as a disease affecting specific sectors of the community , but as a social problem for which there must be adequate welfare provision . Organisations like ACET need this support to enable people like myself to retain maximum control and continue to live at home as independently as we can . I have in recent years edited a self-help journal for people with AIDS , written for the national press and researched a variety of medical material for television . Without the help of ACET and other direct service organisations and charities , I would not have been able to continue and maintain my independence . By working co-operatively , long-term , with the people around me , I hope to continue for some time yet . On Air Director , Dr Patrick Dixon , was involved in numerous radio broadcasts during June , in addition to his appearance on BBC Newsroom South East 's magazine programme as part of our third birthday celebrations . Pre-recorded broadcasts were made by BBC Radio News for Radio 4 's " World at One " and by Independent Radio News ( IRN ) for broadcast during the week of the 7th International Conference on AIDS in Florence . Just before leaving to attend the Conference itself , Patrick fitted in a live broadcast on Radio 4 's " Today Programme " . During the week the BBC took the opportunity to broadcast part of another pre-recorded interview on Radio 4 's " File on 4 " , while Capital Radio broadcast a four-part feature on AIDS , again including a " canned " interview with Patrick . Two BBC World Service broadcasts at the end of the week with Patrick giving his assessment of the Conference . Patrick 's attendance at the Florence Conference was sponsored by the pharmaceutical firm , NAPP . Changes Congratulations to Brian Harris , former Manager of the Education Department , on his new appointment as Manager of a housing project for the Shaftesbury Society in Kilburn . Brian was one of the very first members of the ACET team and will be greatly missed . Denise Jones , responsible for grants and equipment loans , left at the end June to develop her own business , the Belgrave Beauty Clinic in Chiswick , West London . Maurice Adams , formerly Deputy Director with responsibility for new developments in the UK and overseas , is now General Manager of Acet with responsibility for all ACET operations . Rev J Powrie , 22 years Minister of Chalmers -- Ardler Parish Church , Church of Scotland , has recently been appointed as member of ACET 's Advisory Council . Volunteer Needed The need for volunteers from churches , particularly in London and Scotland in the day-time , is an ever constant one . Volunteer Manager , Chris Catlin , says , " We have traditionally recruited volunteers from across the denominations including Anglican , Methodist , Baptist , Catholic and House Churches . After spending some time , often years , with us , people move on to other things and we need to fill the gaps . " All volunteers are trained in a programme designed to : -- give a broad knowledge of HIV and AIDS -- equip an individual on an emotional and practical level to enable them to give compassionate and unconditional care -- equip them to give practical support The training programme itself covers key subjects including : -- death and dying -- sex and sexuality -- responses and reactions -- medical facts -- grief and loss In London , volunteer training programmes will now take place every September and February and will require an individual 's time for one evening a week over a six-week programme . Programmes for the four London areas will take place as follows ; -- South West Thames -- 9th September North West Thames -- 25th September North East Thames -- 2nd October South East Thames -- Date to be fixed during September/ early October All enquiries should be directed to Chris Catlin on 081 840 7879 . Romania Maurice Adams , ACET General Manager , and Overseas Development Worker , Kate Bristow , have recently returned from Romania . Kate has been overseeing an AIDS education course in Constanta together with a local representative , Ana Ureche . A similar course held at the beginning of the year in Brasov , attended by sixty people including teachers , nurses and doctors , was particularly encouraging as much of the material was , in turn , passed on to other colleagues for their use . The success of the initial pilot programme has been recognised by the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Education and led to Maurice , Kate and Ana meeting with Government officials and representatives from UNICEF to establish a long-term training programme in five Romanian regions , starting in November of this year . The attitude of many Romanian health professionals was summed up recently in the words of one doctor in Constanta who said " Health Education is the only " vaccine " we have to fight against HIV . " Kate Bristow commented , " It is a real privilege for ACET to be asked to work with such people as they look for ways to develop an effective strategy . " International Adviser Professor Jonathan Mann , former director of the WHO Global AIDS Programme , has given his backing to ACET by joining Dr Everett Koop the former US Surgeon General , as an International Adviser . Speaking recently at the 7th International AIDS Conference in Florence he said : " I am delighted to support ACET 's developing international AIDS programme . Ten years after the discovery of AIDS we are entering into a new era in the global pandemic , with growing concern about our ability to confront it successfully . New approaches are needed , with close partnerships between local communities , non-government agencies , governments and international organisations . I believe ACET has an important part to play in this process . " He added , " We are just at the beginning of the worldwide epidemic and the situation is still very unstable . The major impact is yet to come . Over the next decade a global approach is going to be essential . " Superintendent Trobridge of Ealing Police Station hands a cheque for �400 to Karen Russell , ACET Trust Manager . The money was part of the proceeds from the sale of unclaimed property sold under the Police Property Act . ACET NEWS AIDS CARE EDUCATION & TRAINING ACET IN THE COMMUNITY Issue 1 AIDS In London Changing Fast MAJOR CHANGES in the pattern of HIV disease occurring in the capital which are not obvious from published statistics . The biggest changes are in the length of time people ill with the disease are now surviving and in the nature of the illnesses themselves . Between 1984 and 1986 those with AIDS died on average some ten months after diagnosis . Between 1987 and 1989 , however , the survival period has already doubled to twenty moths . Patients diagnosed more recently are probably surviving an average of longer than two years . Cause of death The " cause of death " figures are also changing beyond all recognition . The classical pneumocystis pneumonia used to be the final event in the disease process in almost half ( 46 % ) of those with AIDS in 1986 . While pneumonia is still a common occurrence , current preventative measures and improved treatment have reduced the numbers dying as a result to only 3 % by 1989 . This change has big implications for health planners and for those caring for people with AIDS . With the pneumonias , the interval between early chest infection and death could be as little as 12 hours in someone outwardly fit and well . Planning was often difficult or impossible and the need for home care was less . The commonest cause of death is now advanced Kaposi 's Sarcoma ( a kind of cancer ) . Slowly growing internal lesions can produce great difficulties in the lung and the gut , causing shortness of breath and other problems . Internal Kaposi 's Sarcoma can be very painful . Surviving longer Over a year or two , therefore , we have shifted from a population of recently diagnosed AIDS patients , often reasonably well but with lives dominated by a threat of pneumonia , to a population surviving longer and developing a range of further complex problems of a chronic debilitating nature . As London 's largest independent provider of community care for people ill with AIDS , staff at ACET have seen these changes unfold in the home . While numbers of new AIDS cases reported officially each month have remained relatively steady , there has been a big increase in those needing expert medical and nursing advice at home with a 24-hour on call back up . The numbers with pain are also higher . Those at home often need opiates ( morphine-like medicines ) for pain , while one in five will also need a special battery-operated syringe pump , especially if they are too weak to swallow . Specialist care The picture then has changed and we now need to plan for increasing numbers of those with chronic illnesses needing specialist community care -- not just volunteers , although volunteers continue to have a vitally important role to play . Until the numbers of deaths each month has risen to equal or exceed the number of new diagnoses , the numbers needing care will continue to rise fast , even if the number of new cases reported in official figures is relatively constant or falling . These factors help explain some of the reasons why the total number of ACET clients covered at any one time by our on call service in London has more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to over 150 by March 1991 ; and why the nature of the services required has become so much more sophisticated . Professionally-based community care is here to stay and is increasingly needed , backed by access to respite and long stay hospice beds and acute ward facilities . Forward planning and good communication are the two foundation stones that must be in place to guarantee that people ill with HIV have the best choices and continue to enjoy the very best quality of life , wherever they choose to be . " Members of the London Home Care Team from i. to r. -- Kay Hopps , Archie Ferguson , Cedria Clifton , Jackie Sears ( Team Manager ) , Sue Lore and Janet Sutton . " NOTICE BOARD Three ACET staff members , Peter Fabian , Director of Resource Development , Sue Lore , a specialist HIV community nurse and Peter Glover , Press and Information Officer , featured on Radio Thamesmead , North Kent , in an hour-long chat show in April , speaking on AIDS and AIDS care in the community . ACET 's Scottish Office was also featured on " Songs of Praise " on BBC1 . Care-link units , designed to provide remote signalling of distress via the telephone systems , are currently on loan with seven clients in London . Designed originally with the needs of the elderly in mind , those ill with HIV/ AIDS at home are also finding them enormously valuable . Help can be summoned from ACET or other services merely by pressing a button on a pendant worn around the neck . This can make all the difference to someone who feels unsafe alone at home or to partners or friends . Referrals to ACET for Home Care in the London area have increased in the last six months by 50 % . At the present rate of referral , numbers are more than set to double during the year . Around 85 % of those cared for in the capital are gay men , with an increasing number of women and children . Referrals of African men and women infected heterosexually abroad are also increasing . ACET News aims to -- inform Boroughs , Health Authorities , and voluntary agencies of the work of ACET in the community . For more information about ACET 's Home Care Service please call us on 081 840 7879 and ask for Jackie Sears . UK OPERATIONS DIRECTOR APPOINTED Peter Johnson , 38 , has been appointed UK Operations Director , with responsibility for ACET 's existing operations and for new developments within the UK . The rapid growth of ACET since its inception in 1988 has made the creation of this new post a priority . " I was impressed by the care given to our clients in London and elsewhere , " explained Peter , " and the lengths to which ACET staff go to try and meet the needs of clients . I feel that working in partnership with the client , and with other agencies , is the most effective way of ensuring the needs of our clients are met . " Peter studied astronomy at University College , London , and worked in accountancy for a short spell before deciding upon a career in nursing . He spent three years at Charing Cross Hospital School of Nursing before qualifying as a Registered General Nurse in 1983 . Work on a medical ward and as a health visitor followed until in 1988 he became a Neighbourhood Nurse Manager for Wandsworth Health Authority . " I basically managed district nurses , health visitors , school and family planning nurses , " he said . Kay , an ACET nurse , visits a client to administer Petamadine to help prevent him developing pneumocystis corinii pneumonia ( PCP ) . CHILDREN WITH HIV The plight of children infected with HIV was recently highlighted by Princess Diana when she presented a report by the National Children 's Bureau to a London conference on the impact of AIDS on family life . ACET already has experience in caring for children ill with the disease , particularly through its Scottish office . In the experience of ACET staff and volunteers , practical care in the home not only benefits the HIV infected individual but the whole family , which can often mean three generations . At least 60%of the individuals being cared for by ACET in Tayside also have children themselves . Some of these children are infected , but those who are not are still affected by HIV . ACET believes that specialist and volunteer home care is a vital factor in helping to keep families together and lessening the trauma involved when family members are diagnosed HIV positive . PORTSMOUTH OFFICE Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Area Health Authority has recently purchased a building in Portsmouth for the use of AIDS agencies covering the South East Hampshire area . ACET Home Care , which moves into the building in July , will share the offices with two other AIDS charities , P. A. L. S . ( Portsmouth AIDS Link Support ) and the Link Project . The Health Authority has provided funding for the running of ACET 's office including volunteer co-ordinator , Anne Hutchins . Hampshire County Council has provided �20,000 to furnish the building . P. A. L. S . provides counselling and general family support , the Link Project deals with drug-related problems and gives general advice , while ACET provides practical home care not only to the Portsmouth area but also along the South Coast . Living with AIDS by John Creedy TWO AND A HALF years ago I was diagnosed as being HIV positive . It was no particular shock when I found out ; I had expected the test to be positive .

Please write to : THE EDITOR , ACET NEWS , P. O. BOX 1323 , LONDON , W5 5TF . Area Profile EALING IN JANUARY 1988 a small group of 50 would-be volunteers met in the Ealing YMCA to learn about AIDS . This was the beginning of ACET . Many of the first group completed a training course to provide practical help in the home for a small number of people ill with HIV/ AIDS . The first referrals came from Ealing , Acton and surrounding areas . This was coordinated from the living room of a local doctor . The remit of this fledgling group was to provide the highest standards of unconditional care to men , women and children ill at home with HIV/ AIDS . Within a short space of time referrals were regularly coming in . In June 1988 ACET was officially launched as a registered charity . Over the next six months this small group of professionals and volunteers provided practical care for 15 people living in or around the Borough of Ealing . To date ACET has provided professional nursing care or practical help to over 400 individuals across London , excluding hardship grants and equipment loans . In Ealing alone we have received over 30 referrals for Home Care . It has always been ACET 's policy to work with and complement statutory and other voluntary organizations . In Ealing , social workers , H. E. A. R. S ( Hounslow & Ealing AIDS Response Service ) and the Ealing Home Support team have made referrals to ACET to provide for needs where a single agency can not give all of the support required . Likewise ACET has also involved other agencies on behalf of the client . Both the Borough and Health Authority have supported the work of ACET in Ealing by being among the first to provide financial support . ACET is currently working with the Health Authority to develop a service level agreement for 1991/ 92 . A Day in the Life of an ACET Volunteer Monday 8.55am -- I arrive at the office for what looks like a quiet day catching up on necessary office work and telephoning some of our low-dependency clients to see how they are . There 's a message on the answerphone from Tony 's brother . Tony has been unwell over the weekend . One of the nurses rings back , discusses the situation and says she will ring the hospital and/ or his GP to see what can be done . I am asked if I can be on standby if transport is needed ? 9.32am -- Diary check -- a general discussion of appointments and availability for the week follow with Janet , our Co-ordinator . This includes nurses and volunteers . At the moment it looks like my usual stint of ironing on Thursday and shopping on Friday are the main fixtures , but anything can happen before then . 10.10am -- Still no decision about Tony . We are now waiting for the specialist to phone back . Meanwhile , another cry for help . Westminster Hospital , say that Andrew , on of their patients , needs to be admitted but they are unable to find transport as no ambulance is available . No other organisation can help . We agree to help and perhaps I can combine the two visits . 11.00am -- Tony has been given an appointment at the local hospital . I will be able to take him and continue into London to pick up Andrew . At least I 'll be able to have lunch first and not be munching my sandwich in a traffic jam . 1.04pm -- Tony , and his Mum , are still getting ready to arrive . He is not at all well , very breathless , and by the time we are in the care he is gasping for air . 1.05pm -- Having left Tony and his Mum at his appointment , I set off in the direction of the A4 . 2.30pm -- I arrive at Andrew 's house . Although he is suffering from a type of septicaemia , he is clearly having a good spell . We make the most of this and scoot off to the hospital . 3.35pm -- Arrive back at hospital no.1 . Tony is to be admitted but ... wait for it ... to yet another hospital ! If I ca n't take him he will have a two-hour wait for an ambulance . I 've heard of a pub crawl ... but a hospital crawl ? 4.00pm -- We set off again ; this time via Tony 's home to collect a variety of possessions , finally arriving at hospital no.3 . 4.55pm -- Tony is ushered into a side ward with three doctors and I stay outside with Mum . The only problem is , she is Ugandan and speaks very little English , has no idea how to get home and has no money for transport . I try to explain that , unlike her home country , she will not be staying in with him . Nobody seems to have explained this to her , but finally she understands . Her daughters have however been contacted so I agree to keep her company until they arrive . 5.45pm -- They finally turn up . As the doctors are still with Tony , I explain the position to the daughters and hand Mum over to them . 6.30pm -- Home at last ! Of course , I still need to catch up on that necessary office work , maybe tomorrow ... Cedria is a full-time volunteer and one of national network of volunteers . Both full- and part-time work is carefully organised according to the availability and skills of each volunteer . All volunteers are carefully selected and trained . What is ACET ?

A friend can infect you without your knowing . No cure for AIDS Once you 're infected the virus may destroy your natural defences for over 10 years without you realising . And you an pass on the infection again without knowing . There is no cure . Once infected , you will -- sooner or later -- develop fullblown AIDS . Friends or partners may soon be ill too . The truth about AIDS THE DOCTOR SAYS : " HIV IS THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES AIDS . " HIV spreads between people who have sexual intercourse together , or who share needles when injecting drugs , or from mother to unborn child . The most common way for the virus to spread is through unprotected sexual intercourse between two people , one of whom is infected . You can be tested for infection at a special hospital clinic . But remember you have to wait at least 12 weeks after the possible infection for the test result to be accurate . THERE IS STILL NO CURE , NO VACCINE , NO WONDER DRUG , FOR HIV INFECTION OR AIDS . SAFE ! YOU CA N'T CATCH HIV IN ANY OF THESE WAYS : from a toilet from mosquito bites from giving blood from a swimming pool from kissing from day-to-day contact It 's very safe receiving blood transfusions . The chance of getting infected from a pint of blood is less than 1 in a million . What is AIDS ? Risky sex or dirty needles send HIV into the blood . The virus , HIV , enters a " soldier " cell . The soldier cell is programmed to make up 1000s of new HIV particles . Then it bursts , dies , and releases all these viruses into the blood . Over the next 5-15 years , 1000s more soldier cells in the body get infected . They make millions of viruses , before they too die off . A new germ enters the body . Now there are n't enough " soldier " cells to beat the germ , so it multiplies . The body is seriously infected . Hospital treatment is needed . Some die of the infection . Most recover gradually . Until the next germ arrives ... Sex and AIDS " I 've been to fifteen funerals of my friends this year . They all died through AIDS . Now it 's my turn . " J. L. , London Tom is a lorry-driver . He 's infected with the virus causing AIDS , but does n't know . ( He could have been infected by 1 of at least 3 different ways . What are they ? * ) * Answer : a . He could be infected by sexual intercourse with an infected woman . b . He could be infected by injecting drugs using a shared needle and syringe . c . He could be infected by sex with a man or boy . Tom has in turn infected Mary and Sam -- he 's bisexual . Still not knowing he 's infected , Tom marries Janet . A year later , she 's infected too . One day Tom is rushed to hospital with an unusual type of pneumonia . Now the doctor tell shim he has AIDS . Tom has infected at least 6 people -- thought he has never even met Jane , Mark and Alan . Over a period of time they will all be ill . When sex can cause disease Rapid spread Until recently it was reckoned that men and women on average had sex with 6 different people in their lifetime . And those 6 partners with 36 more ... So one person could receive sexually-transmitted diseases ( STDs ) from up to 40,000 other people ! " But I 've only had sex with one person , " you say . It only needs one person to pass on an infection . Sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) Each year in the UK hospital that more than 500,000 new cases of STDs . These include gonorrhoea , syphilis , herpes , genital warts , chlamydia , and now , HIV infection . Some of these diseases are becoming more and more resistant to treatment . For most of them there is a cure ; but as yet not for HIV infection . Sexually transmitted diseases can prevent women from conceiving children . It 's possible that a sexually-transmitted infection might cause cancer of the cervix -- especially if you 're under 20 . Tell-tale signs Soreness in the groin , or a discharge from the genitals , can be a sign of some sexually transmitted diseases . But often the person infected does n't notice anything wrong . What to do If you 're worried that you 've recently take a risk , go to the special STD clinic at your local hospital . They will check you , and treat you if necessary . They 're used to these diseases . Do n't hesitate to go . Two experts discuss HIV in front of hugely-magnified projection of soldier cells . Those coloured red are infected . Sex : It 's your choice SAFE Close relationships that stop short of sexual intercourse . Staying a virgin till you meet the right person -- also a virgin -- and ... staying faithful to that one person for the rest of your life . Also , neither of you ever injecting drugs . LOW RISK Sex with a condom that contains nonoxynol spermicide . HIGHER RISK Sex without a condom . ( How can you be sure your partner is n't infected ? ) VERY HIGH RISK Injecting drugs with a shared needle and syringe . ( 20 people can get infected in a single evening this way . ) Why do people get into drugs ? " It looks cool ... " There 's a party . Stuff is getting passed round . It can seem hard to say " No " ! Particularly if you 're not feeling confident . " I 'm curious ... " People climb mountains " because they 're there " . They make parachute drops " to see what it 's like " . Why not drugs ? Because shooting your brain to bits is n't worth it ! " I 'm looking for meaning to life ... " Some people think drugs can help you find God , or discover the meaning of life . OK -- when you 're in a dazed state , drugs may make you think you understand it all . But some drugs cause bad , disturbing flashbacks . " I ca n't cope with life ... " Many people who use drugs regularly find it difficult to exist in a drug-free world . They can become crippled psychologically and hooked physically . Even after " drying out " , they may feel strongly pulled back into the drug world . Drugs often make people feel they 're coping , when they 're really not coping at all . Trading Death A big problem Drugs are never cheap . The effects never last long and you always want more . A paper round or weekend job does n't pay enough . Stealing , cheating and lying become the only way to pay . It 's always on your mind You ca n't look your family in the eye . Your friends begin to wonder what is wrong . You begin to hate yourself for what you 're doing . Things are always on your mind . Trying to feel better by using more never seems to work for long . Drugs and AIDS Drugs damage your body . They can kill , and injecting drugs with a shared needle or syringe can be the fastest way to get HIV -- even if you only do it once . Why you should say " NO " to drugs ! Once you 've taken the drug , your next decision could be influenced by that drug . It could ruin your entire life . Some drugs can hook you almost instantly . If you say YES -- that could be your last free decision . Drugs are no substitute for real living . They ca n't give you a purpose or meaning in life . No-one has the right to pressure you . You 're always free to say NO ! " I think I 'm in love ... " " How do I know if I 've met the right person ? " Most experts say that the happiest -- and longest -- relationships are based on close friendship and shared interests , not just strong feelings . It take s lot more than just physical attraction to make a lasting , happy marriage . Strong friendship takes time to build . Many people say that sex is most fulfilling when it expresses the commitment , care , security and understanding of an exclusive friendship . Friendship takes time . In most happy marriages , husband and wife continue to make time to be with each other , and to understand each other . How does AIDS affect you ? We say someone has AIDS when the virus has weakened the body so much that certain new illnesses are developing . For example , if the " soldier " cells are weakened , the chest can be infected . It gets harder to breathe -- and you may die . Your gut can get infected , so you ca n't absorb the goodness in your food . You lose weight , you feel very weak , and pass motions up to 10 times a day . This person with the HIV infection has developed a sore mouth Cancers may grow . For example , there is a skin cancer called Kaposi 's sarcoma . If you have AIDS , a germ can destroy your eyesight . You can also find it hard to remember things , because germs are multiplying in your brain . People with AIDS are often well for long periods between times of illness . A woman receiving urgent hospital treatment for AIDS . How to keep healthy Never share a needle or syringe if you 're injecting drugs . Always use a condom ( unless you 're absolutely sure your partner is not infected ) * . This reduces the risk of infection -- it does n't eliminate it . Reduce the number of partners you have sex with . Aim at having only 1 sexual partner for the rest of your life If you would like to take to someone about matters covered in this booklet , there is a free and confidential service : National AIDS HELPLINE : Freephone 0800 567 123 * How can you be sure ?

AIDS a caring response ACET THE CHALLENGE The chronic nature of AIDS means that people 's needs are many and varied . For many a stay in hospital is in appropriate but they are often too weak or ill to care for themselves properly . For some this makes hospitalization inevitable . When someone is ill with AIDS they are often in pain . Exhaustion is a permanent feature preventing the completion of even the most simple task . Friends and family often reject them , leaving them free to face this chronic condition alone . Without ACET 's practical support at home they could spend long periods of time in hospital unnecessarily . The reality of AIDS is that the person can die at any time . The person 's need to know " when and how " is sometimes overwhelming . One of the difficulties is that every person 's situation is different . The medical aspects can be dementia , sudden blindness , loss of mobility , thrush , shingles , Kaposi 's sarcoma ( a type of cancer ) , weight loss , or any combination of these . The person 's circumstances may change rapidly , from owner occupier to homelessness ; from a good income to living on sickness benefit ; from young and active to housebound and disabled . ACET 'S HOME CARE SERVICE ACET provides a dedicated Home Care service using a team of doctors and nurses backed by a trained and active network of over 400 volunteers . The service includes pain and symptom control and nursing advice . Volunteers cook , clean , nightsit and carry out DIY and many other tasks . Our aim is to enable people to live and to die at home if that is their wish and appropriate to their needs . The stigma still associated with AIDS means that often those who have the disease are isolated . ACET ca n't replace family and friends but can provide the practical care and support to enable people with HIV/ AIDS related illnesses to stay at home . EDUCATION ACET through its schools education programme aims to reduce the number of new infections by giving young people the facts about AIDS . We have already visited over 90 schools and reached 36,000 pupils . OVERSEAS ACET has already been drawn overseas and is working in Romania , Uganda and Tanzania , in partnership with local church-based projects and in conjunction with government programmes . Our assistance is offered sensitively and in a culturally appropriate way . THE FUTURE In the UK we have offices in London , Portsmouth , Northampton , Belfast , Dundee and Edinburgh . If we are to continue providing unconditional practical care on such a wide level then we need your support today . It costs about �2,000 to care for someone between referral to ACET and their death . This works out at the equivalent of just �10 per day . All our programmes need your continued support . Despite the fact that we do n't hear so much about AIDS these days the problems are increasing . If you would like to support the work of ACET then please complete the coupon and return it to us today . Thank you . AIDS a caring response ACET -- AIDS Care Education and Training is a national and international church-based charity with offices in the UK , Romania and Uganda . The charity was launched in June 1988 by Dr Patrick Dixon , a specialist in care for the dying and author or two books on the subject of AIDS . Initial sponsorship was provided by World in Need , a charity which also helped launch Action Aid and Help the Aged . ACET is committed to the unconditional care of all those who are ill with HIV/ AIDS regardless of race , religion , lifestyle , sex , sexuality or any other factor . We provide professionally based practical home care to men , women and children who are ill at home with HIV/ AIDS related illness . Since launching our UK service we have received over 1,200 requests for practical help . This makes us the largest independent provider of practical home care to people with AIDS in the UK . DONATION Yes , I would like to make ACET 's Home Care service and Education Programmes more widely available and enclose a donation of : COVENANT COVENANT COVENANT GIVING TO ACET ? This leaflet tries to answer some of the questions you might have on giving to ACET by covenant . Is a covenant the only method of tax-effective giving ? No . Since 1987 it has been possible to ask your employer to deduct regular sums from your pay through the PAYROLL GIVING SCHEME up to a maximum of �600 per annum ( not all employers offer their employees this facility ) . From lst October 1990 , there is also a new scheme called GIFT AID which allows you to give sums of �600 or more to a charity tax-effectively ( with a maximum of �5 million for your total charitable donations in any one tax year ) . A separate leaflet gives details of that scheme . Is a covenant complicated ? Not really . A Deed of Covenant is a legal document which needs to be correctly drawn up and signed . The law relating to covenants is quite complex but basically a covenant is a legally-binding document by which you transfer some of your income to a charity for a stated period . ACET is a charity , registered with the Charity Commission under Registration Number 299293 . As far as you are concerned , a covenant can be exceedingly simple . There is a simple covenant form attached to this leaflet which is quite sufficient . All you have to do is to fill in the details , including your name and address and the amount you wish to give , and sign and date the document in front of a witness . You will also be asked to sign a Certificate of Deduction of Tax once a year confirming that you are a UK taxpayer . This is all you need do for the tax benefit of covenant giving to work . The value of your gift then increases by 33.3 % in ACET 's hands , with the blessing of the Inland Revenue . How long does a covenant have to last ? At the time you enter a Deed of Covenant , the covenant should be capable of lasting for more than 3 years , and there should be the intention by you that it does so . This is why the normal period for a charitable covenant is 4 years . But it is possible to have a covenant which lasts for a longer period , provided that the period is specified in the Deed . Do I need to go to a lawyer ? No . It does not need a lawyer either to draw up any document or to advise you although you may wish to consult a professional adviser if a particularly large sum is involved or if there are complicated conditions surrounding the gift . How should I make my payments ? You can pay by cash or by cheque . If you pay by cash you will normally obtain a receipt as proof of payment . If you use the covenant form attached to this leaflet you can make each annual payment at any time , or by any instalments , you wish as long as you make the full annual payment by the end of each 12-month period . Since you are agreeing to make regular payments over a number of years , it is probably easier for you to pay by Banker 's Order or Direct Debit Mandate when the payments will automatically be made from your bank account . There is a Banker 's Order form attached to this leaflet which you can use . Make sure that the amount of the payment is the net sum mentioned in the Deed of Covenant or the appropriate proportion of that net sum if you wish to pay by quarterly or monthly instalments . Also make sure that the Banker 's Order terminates with the final covenant payment . Can I increase my covenant payment ? The simple answer is No . The amount of the annual covenant payment is specified in the Deed , and this is the sum that is payable each year . If you wish to increase your support , you can simply write a cheque for the additional amount you wish to give . But this is not tax-effective and ACET will not benefit from the additional 33.3 % increase in value . You can use the GIFT AID scheme if you wish to give another �600 or more . Or you can enter into a second Deed of Covenant committing yourself to make payments under both the existing and new covenants . As a further alternative , you can enter into a Supplemental Deed . This has the effect of cancelling your existing covenant and in return you commit yourself to making payments under the new covenant . This procedure is perfectly acceptable provided that your new commitments are at least as great as the remaining commitments due under the orignal covenant . Can I extend my covenant , if I wish to continue making payments over a longer period ? Again the answer is no . The length of the covenant will have been specified in the Deed , and it will terminate when the last specified annual payment has been made . At that stage you can enter into a new covenant . How much can I covenant ? Covenant payments are made out of your income and are not capital payments . You could covenant all your taxable income if you wished -- remember though that a part of your total income will not be subject to tax , because of the various tax allowances you enjoy ( personal allowances , mortgage interest relief , etc . ) If you are planning to give a particularly large sum , it is always more advantageous to give out of income by covenant than to give a capital sum . You can spread the payments over as long a period as you like . Using the " Deposited Covenant " procedure you can pay over the whole of the donation in one go , and we can give you full details of how to do this . Alternatively , you could use the GIFT AID scheme ( see separate leaflet ) . What happens if I do not pay UK Income Tax ? This can cause problems , since you agree under the terms of the covenant to make payments out of income from which tax has been deducted . If you have not paid tax , then you would not be able to sign a Certificate of Deduction of Tax and ACET would not be able to reclaim tax on the covenant . If ACET did somehow reclaim tax on the covenant then you would be liable to pay income tax to the Inland Revenue on the amount of your covenant payment . So if you are not a UK taxpayer you are advised not to enter into Deeds of Covenant , but to make your regular charitable payments by simple Banker 's Order without any covenant . You may in fact find that you do pay some tax in the UK . If you have dividend or receive bank or building society interest on which tax has been paid , tax will have been deducted at source , and this will enable you to sign a Certificate of Deduction of Tax so that ACET can obtain the advantages of covenant giving . Which spouse should enter into the covenant ? Since 6th April 1990 , married couples have been taxed independently , and each spouse is responsible for paying tax on his/ her own income . If you do not pay income tax , but your spouse does , you should not enter into a Deed of Covenant on your own . Either you should ask your spouse to enter into the covenant or you could enter into a Joint Deed of Covenant signed by both you and your spouse . In either event your spouse should actually make the covenant payments , not you . In the same way , if your spouse pays income tax at the higher rate and you pay tax at only the ( lower ) basic rate , then in order to obtain Higher Rate Tax Relief , your spouse should enter into the covenant , or into a Joint Deed of Covenant with you , and he/ she should actually make the covenant payments . This Higher Rate Tax Relief will save 20 % of the cost of the covenant payments . COVENANT FORM FOR UK TAX PAYERS Can I backdate a covenant to cover donations I have already made ? The answer is No . A covenant is a legally binding document to make regular donations , and such donations must be made under the terms of an existing Deed of Covenant for tax to be reclaimable . Thus , the first payment should be on or after the date on which the Deed of Covenant is signed . You can not simply draw up a covenant ( or a Deposited Covenant Agreement ) to cover a donation you have already made in the hope that ACET can obtain tax advantage on the sum given . However , it can be possible for the documents to be signed after you have sent a payment by cheque provided that you arrange for us to hold the cheque and not pay it into the bank until we have received the signed Deed of Covenant . What happens if I have difficulty in continuing to make payments ? If this unlikely situation arises , you should discuss the problem with us . Although ACET , like any charity , does not have the power to release you from the agreement it is likely to be sympathetic . For instance we can suggest ways of rescheduling the payments over a longer period . Whatever happens , any tax relief obtained on donations you have already made will not be lost . It is possible to include in the wording of the Deed that the covenant will cease if certain conditions occur -- for example , if you become unemployed or your income falls below a certain level . But , unless you are considering a particularly large donation , it is unlikely that you would need to include any complicated form of wording . The Inland Revenue will not accept " escape " conditions which would effectively enable you to terminate the covenant of your own volition . GIFT AID GIFT AID GIVING TO ACET BY GIFT AID This leaflet tries to answer some of the questions you might have on giving to ACET through the Gift Aid scheme . 1 . What is Gift Aid ? Gift Aid is a scheme which gives tax relief for " one-off " contributions to charity and it came into force on 1st October 1990 . Until then an individual could obtain income tax relief for a gift to charity only if the gift was made under a Deed of Covenant . 2 . How does Gift Aid work ? The mechanism of Gift Aid is very simple . Provided the gift is at least �600 it will be regarded as having been paid net of basic rate tax . The charity is able to recover the basic rate tax " deducted " and the donor can , if appropriate , obtain higher rate tax relief on his payment . Say , for example , you pay �750 to ACET under Gift Aid . The net payment is equivalent to a gross sum of �1,000 . ACET an claim repayment of �250 so it received the full �1,000 . If you pay tax at the higher rate you will personally obtain further relief of 15 % on the gross figure , so making the net cost of the payment to you �600 . ( The tax rates cited are those in force in 1990/ 91 ) . The key to the working of Gift Aid is a certificate which must be signed by the donor . Without that certificate , the charity can not obtain the repayment of the basic rate tax and the donor can not get higher rate relief . The Inland Revenue form R190(SD ) contains the certificate and the form requires the donor to state that he satisfies all the conditions relating to Gift Aid ( as to which , see 4 below ) , including the fact that he has paid , or will pay , tax equal to the basic rate on the gross amount of the gift . In the above example the gross amount of the gift was �1,000 , so the donor would have to certify that he would be paying tax of at least �250 . This last point must not be overlooked and may prevent large capital sums being passed under Gift Aid ( but see 6. below ) . You also need to bear in mind that you may have other payments under existing deeds of covenant or other payments made under Gift Aid in the same tax year , and you will need to have a taxable income at least equal to the gross amount of all these payment , as well as the Gift Aid payment being contemplated , otherwise you will have to account to the Revenue for some tax . 3 . What are the advantages of Gift Aid over a Deed of Covenant ? There are several differences : ( i ) To be effective for tax purposes a Deed of Covenant has to turn for a period capable to exceeding three years . The intention of a Gift Aid scheme is to encourage giving without the donor being tied to a particular charity for this length of time . ( ii ) Under Gift Aid there are no formalities at the time of the gift , just a cheque or cash gift to the charity . The certificate on form R190(SD ) must be completed but this can be done at any time and amounts to little more than a claim procedure . With a payment under covenant , The Deed of Covenant has to be filled in corrected before a payment is made . ( iii ) Since Gift Aids applies to a single gifts it can be a very useful means of making a charitable gift towards the end of the tax year when your taxable income for the year can be estimated with some degree of precision . This applies particularly to self-employed persons . But to gain the advantages of the Gift Aid scheme certain conditions have to be complied with . 4 . What are the conditions to Gift Aid ? ( i ) Cash only . Only payments of cash of at least �600 fall within the scope of Gift Aid . Cash includes cheque payments , bank transfers and credit card payments . Thus the transfer of an asset to a charity e. g. a work of art , will not qualify ( although there are other ways for a charity to obtain tax relief on the gift of an asset ) . Nor will it be possible to make a regular contributions below the �600 limit ( though see 5. below ) . ( ii ) No repayment . A payment only qualifies under Gift Aid if it is a " gift " . Thus it must be made absolutely with no conditions about repayment . ( iii ) No debt cancelled . Gift Aid may not be used by a donor as a means of writing of a debt or loan owed to him by the charity . ( iv ) No benefit . Any benefit enjoyed by the donor or a " connected person " as a consequence of making a gift under Gift Aid must not exceed the lower of �250 or 2� % of the value of the gift . A " connected person " broadly speaking means any close relative . ( v ) Not connected with acquisition of property . A payment will not qualify under Gift Aid if it is made to enable the charity to purchase a property , or other assets , from the donor or from a " connected person " . ( vi ) UK resident . The donor must be resident in the United Kingdom at the time that the gift is made . If a nonresident wishes to make a tax effective gift out of UK source income he should use a Deed of Covenant . ( vii ) Minimum and maximum amounts . The minimum donation which an individual can make under the Gift Aid is �600 . the total donations which an individual may make under Gift Aid in any tax year must not exceed �5,000,000 . 5 . What if I wish to give small amounts regularly over a period ? Payments qualify for tax relief under gift Aid only if the donation is for �600 or more . If you wish to give small amounts regularly , e. g. monthly , you could accumulate the money in a separate account and then convert this to a gift to ACET every time the amount reaches �600 . In this way your gift to ACET will qualify for Gift Aid relief even though the monthly payments would be too small to do so . Thus if you set aside �25 per month it would take two years to accumulate the �600 minimum for the Gift Aid scheme . If for any reason you wanted to give each monthly payment direct to ACET , we could hold the money in an account in your name until the amount accumulated reaches the �600 threshold . Care would be needed with the wording used in any such scheme and ACET can give you more details about this . 6 . What if I wish to give a sum of capital or a sum in excess of my annual taxable income ? If you wish to give a capital sum to ACET ( e. g. from an inheritance your have received ) or an amount of money that exceeds your taxable for the tax year of the gift , ACET can still get tax relief on your gift if you enter into a Deposited Covenant arrangement . This is quite separate from Gift Aid and details can be supplied on request . Likewise , if you wished to make a single gift to ACET of less than �600 then -- assuming that you are a taxpayer -- you can enable ACET to get the benefit of tax relief by the same Deposited Covenant arrangement . DONATION 7 . What happens if I do not pay UK income tax ? This can cause problems because if you do not pay tax then you will not be able to sign the Certificate on form R190(SD ) and ACET would not be able to re-claim basic rate on the payment . If ACET did somehow reclaim tax on the payment then you would be liable to pay income tax to the Inland Revenue on the amount of your Gift Aid payment . So if you are not a UK taxpayer you are advised not to make a payment under the Gift Aid scheme but to make a straight payment by cash or cheque . You may in fact find that you do pay some tax in the UK If you have dividends or receive bank or building society interest on which tax has been paid , tax will have beed deducted at source , and this will enable you to sign a Certificate so that ACET can obtain the advantages of the Gift Aid scheme . 8 . Which spouse should make the Gift Aid payment ? Since 6th April 1990 , married couples have been taxed independently , and each spouse is responsible for paying tax on his/ her own income . If you do not pay income tax but your spouse does , then your spouse should make the Gift Aid payment . Similarly , if your spouse pays income tax at the higher rate and you pay tax at only the ( lower ) basic rate , then your spouse should make the Gift Aid payment in order to obtain the higher rate relief . LEGACY LEAVING A LEGACY TO ACET Why should I make a Will ? If I do n't make a Will , then the distribution of what you possess when you die may not be as you would wish . Many people wrongly assume that all they have automatically goes to their loved ones . This is n't necessarily so and by neglecting to make a valid , legal Will families put at risk the security and future of their nearest and dearest . Also , by making a proper Will you could well save your dependants from paying an unnecessary amount of inheritance tax ( death duties ) . Moreover , death is a time of great stress to those you love most . Not to have made a Will can only add to that stress . How do I make a Will ? There is nothing complicated about it . A Will is simply a clear statement about how your money and possessions are to be divided when you die . But do not make one without the advice of a solicitor . He will help you draw up accurately what you need to say . He will help you to observe the legal requirements and to name Executors to carry out your instructions , to appoint guardians if necessary and to cancel any previous Wills . He will advise you on the inheritance tax your estate might incur and ways in which this may be reduced . He will be able to remind you of beneficiaries you might otherwise forget . Who will deal with my estate when I die ? It is most important to appoint at least one Executor when you make your Will . It is in fact advisable to name more than one Executor in case one of them dies before you . Choose people you know well and trust and with whom you can share the details of your affairs . A solicitor or accountant can act as an Executor if you so wish . It does n't matter if your Executor stands to benefit from the Will . How can I reduce the amount of inheritance tax payable on my estate ? At present , the first �128,000 of any estate is free of inheritance tax . Anything over this amount is , basically , liable to inheritance tax at 40 % . There are exemptions for gifts to spouses and to charity . Of course , taking account of the value of a house and its contents and personal savings and investments it is not surprising that a great many people have estates that exceed the inheritance tax threshold . However , a gift to ACET is completely free of inheritance tax , due to the fact that ACET is a charity . Money that is otherwise destined for the Inland Revenue can instead go to ACET . And �400 of tax can be saved for every �1,000 that you give . ( Figures correct as at Feb. 1991 ) . An example Let 's say that your estate is worth �140,000 , net of liabilities . As this is over the inheritance tax threshold , it would bring a tax bill of �4,800 . By leaving �5,000 to ACET , however , the taxable value of your estate is reduced to �135,000 and this would give a tax saving of �2,000 . What form of words should I use for a legacy to ACET ? It might be helpful to take to your solicitor a form of words to cover your gift to ACET and we suggest the following : " To ACET of Paramount House , 71/ 75 Uxbridge Road , Ealing , London W5 for its general purposes ( one of these alternatives ) : " 1 . " ... the sum of � " . 2 . " ... all the residue of my estate " . 3 . " one share of the residue of my estate " . " And I declare that the receipt of the Treasurer or other proper officer of ACET shall be a sufficient discharge to my Executors " .

We are given some financial support from the government but this doe snot cover all our costs and we therefore depend on gifts from trusts , companies and individuals . If you would like to help us financially why not ask one of our Home Care team for details . MEETING YOUR NEEDS ACET recognises that people can have needs in many areas . We are committed to the practical care of all those who are ill with AIDS/ HIV regardless of race , religion , lifestyle , sex , sexuality or any other factor . Our trained workers find that some of those we care for want to talk through emotional and spiritual issues . ACET is a church-based organisation whose primary concern is practical care rather than counselling , and so these areas are only covered if they are raised by our clients .

This leaflet explains how ACET Home Care in London would help you , or someone you know . A CHRISTIAN RESPONSE TO AIDS AIDS CARE EDUCATION AND TRAINING Why do we need a Christian response to AIDS ? AIDS is the biggest health challenge we have had to face this century . Already more children may be dying with AIDS than from famine and 11 million are carrying the virus HIV , 1 in 250 of all adults worldwide . AIDS touches areas of sickness , death and personal behaviour . It brings out prejudice and fear , and people with the disease are often isolated and rejected . Meanwhile health campaigns have largely failed so far to change behaviour . The church should be able to respond to these urgent needs more effectively than any other group and provide clear leadership . The church can give care and compassion to those affected by AIDS and help prevent infection . World Health Organisation figures . Volunteers Provide Transport Daysit Nightsit Housework Cook Collect Prescriptions Befriend ACET Home Care ACET is a Christian response to AIDS . We are the largest independent provider of practical home care to people with HIV/ AIDS in the U. K. From 7 regional offices we have provided practical care to over 1000 people in the lat 3 years and in the last 12 months we cared for at least 1 in 5 of those who died of AIDS in the U. K. Our Home Care teams are made up of doctors and nurses backed by a network of trained and active volunteers . Our staff and volunteers are drawn from churches of all denominations . Without their commitment we would not be able to provide such an extensive service . Regional Offices London Edinburgh Glasgow Dundee Portsmouth Northampton Belfast Kampala , Uganda Constanta , Romania Schools Education Sexual activity among teenagers is increasing fast -- even in our churches . A recent survey of church youth groups shows that 1 in 4 have had sex by the time they are eighteen years old , 1 in 10 under the age of sixteen . Outside the church the statistics are higher still . Prevention of infection is a major part of our response to HIV/ AIDS and we are the largest independent provider of schools classes on AIDS . Our aim is to reduce the number of new HIV infections by giving young people the facts about AIDS and by encouraging them to think about their future . So far we have visited over 100 schools and talked to more than 50,000 pupils . Survey of 150 church youth groups across the denominations -- 1729 interviewed ( Agape 1991 ) Overseas By the turn of the century 9 out of 10 with HIV will be in developing countries -- some 36 million people . Many churches overseas are struggling to meet the AIDS challenge . In some countries one third of all adults in towns and cities are already infected . The effect in the future will be devastating . ACET 's work with the churches in Africa and Romania has been recognised and supported by UNICEF , the World Health Organisation and by TEAR Fund . We run training programmes in Romania and support care and prevention programmes in Uganda and Tanzania . What can your church do ? Your church can become a partner with ACET . If we are to continue to meet the rapidly growing needs of those who look to us for care and prevention , we urgently need you to share the challenge with us . This is why we are asking your church to link with ACET in a Christian response to AIDS both at home and overseas . Churches working together ACET can help your church with - Speakers for services , seminars or workshops . - Training church members as community volunteers . - Information , newsletters and advice . ACET can help your church with - Making members aware of our work . - Appointing a member of your church as an ACET-Link representative . - Encouraging volunteer involvement . - Supporting us financially . - Praying regularly . ACET Aims - To provide practical care and support to men , women and children with AIDS , irrespective of race , religion , lifestyle , sexual orientation or any other factor . - To reduce the number of new HIV infections by giving young people the facts about AIDS . - To help provide a local response to a global problem . - To equip the Church to make an effective Christian response to AIDS , respecting the historic teachings of the church and providing unconditional care . PATRONS : The most Reverend and Right honourable the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury Dr George Carey BD Mth Phd Cliff Richard OBE General Eva Burrows OA Head of Salvation Army on behalf of a client " On behalf of the family of my late brother , Robert , I wish to thank you for the compassion and care shown to him by your organization during his long and difficult illness . Please convey our gratitude to the volunteers concerned . Robert found peace and assurance before his death and I believe such was achieved partly by the demonstration of the love of Jesus shown by you . " on behalf of a client " Thank you for all the help you gave to us and to Bob during the last few days of his illness -- I only wish we 'd been put in touch with ACET sooner . I was particularly impressed by the way you managed to organise all the available services so efficiently -- just at the time when we were beginning to wonder how we 'd manage . " Dr S J Bowcock Former Senior Registrar in Haematology , Hammersmith Hospital " I would like to thank you and your Team for all the effort and resources you have put into providing a home care service for our patients . Your Team has been invaluable in providing psychological as well as practical support for these patients which have been grossly lacking through the conventional channels . I hope that you might be able to continue to help our patients in this manner . " Villiers High School " I would like once again to thank you for the major contribution you 've made to our AIDS education programme this year . I feel that this is reflected not just in the increased knowledge of the students but also in a change of attitude and a few greater degrees of empathy . " Roger Stephenson Fairlight Christian Centre " If there is to be an effective Christian response to AIDS we need to support organisations like ACET who are in the front line giving practical care and support . " Peter Ronayne St Lukes , West Norwood , Church of England " ACET is working in this field because , like Jesus , they are getting alongside those in need and helping the rest of us to understand and minister to those both infected and affected . " David Wise Greenford Baptist Church " Members of my church have been working with ACET since it started 3 years ago . I have seen for myself the value of ACET 's work in the community and I would whole heartedly recommend other churches get behind the work in any way they can .

After only three years we are now caring for one in four of those dying with AIDS in the UK . The growing number of men , women and children with AIDS and the fact that people with the disease now survive longer , have made ever more pressing demands on our Home Care teams . In the schools the needs for AIDS education has never been greater . To meet the challenge we have strengthened our management team to provide the foundation for further soundly based growth . It is now more than ever clear that every section of society needs to be involved in responding to AIDS , including the churches . ACET is a Christian initiative supported by all denominations . It is the churches that provide our volunteers ; without their support we would not be able to provide a service at all . The work they do is an inspiring example of what loving community care is all about . Governmental organisations support us financially . So do companies and trusts , and churches and individuals . We thank them . AIDS is here to stay . In 1991/ 92 we shall need support even more . Every donation does help . That help makes all the difference to people sick with AIDS who want to stay at home , rather than spend time unnecessarily in hospital . Please help ! SIR JOHN FORD KCMG MG CHAIRMAN OF TRUSTEES ACET 's mission To give practical care to men , women and children ill at home with HIV/ AIDS . To prevent new HIV infections through a schools education programme . DIRECTOR 'S REPORT THE GROWING PROBLEM Travelling to several countries over the last year , has brought it home to me how disastrous are the effects , worldwide , of the virus causing AIDS . During the past year at least 1.5 million more men , women and children have become infected with HIV . AIDS affects over 160 countries and is now taking an increasingly heavy toll . By the year 2000 the World Health Organisation estimates that up to 40 million people will be infected with HIV . Despite public perceptions , across the world 7 out of 10 infections are heterosexual . WHO press release April 1991 . In the UK the spread of infection has slowed down but the numbers ill and needing care are continuing to rise and this is a reflection of levels of infection some years ago . HOME CARE IN THE UK The need for a national and international AIDS charity has never been greater . As the UK 's main independent AIDS home care provider , we cared for around 25 % of all those who died of AIDS last year . In London , demand for our Home Care services doubled over the last twelve months . We are the largest independent provider of professional home care in the capital giving pain control , nursing and medical advice , 24 hour on call , emotional support and practical volunteer help , including nightsitting . I expect demand for this service to continue to grow over the coming year . AIDS deaths : April 1990 -- March 1991 , UK total ( CDSC figures -- 584 April 1991 . ) Our Home Care teams saw 141 AIDS related deaths last year In Scotland rapidly growing numbers of ill men , women and children at home have stretched our Edinburgh and Dundee teams to the limit . Complex social problems have to be tackled including homelessness , imprisonment , birth of an infected child and death of one or even both parents . I am pleased to report further extensions of home care over the last year to meet the growing needs in Glasgow and also to cover a greater area of the South Coast and the East Midlands . This means that around 70 % of all those with AIDS in the UK live in areas served by ACET Home Care . PREVENTION IN SCHOOLS Every day more young people are infected with HIV -- often completely unaware they have been personally at risk -- and risky behaviour is on the increase again . Effective prevention has never been more urgently needed , especially in schools . ACET educators see up to 4,000 pupils a month in face-to-face school presentations . This year a total of 24,000 attended compared with 14,500 in 1989/ 90 . Every educator has a personal story to tell from working in our home care teams . Evaluations show these educators have a high impact and real credibility with 13 to 18 year olds . School teachers and parents know they need help to make AIDS real . Our new 24 page full colour schools booklet has been widely acclaimed by teachers and pupils as the best AIDS resource they have ever seen . In Northern Ireland our work has been warmly received by both communities and their churches . AFRICA -- WHERE DO YOU START ? With possibly one in three of adults in some African towns and cities already HIV infected , it is hard to know how to begin to help . Whole communities are being shaken by large numbers of deaths among young adults and young children . Half a million babies have already been born with HIV in Africa . Ten million children with be AIDS orphans by the year 2000 . WHO press release April 1991 . We are seeking to provide urgent help to churches and Christian organisations in their prevention campaigns and care programmes , working closely with Tear Fund , the World Health Organisation , UNICEF and governments . As a result of preparatory work , programmes will be starting in the next few months in Uganda and Tanzania . CHILDREN IN ROMANIA Romania has been hit by a major tragedy with hundreds of young children HIV infected through hazardous medical or nursing treatments . New children are being put at risk every day because many care workers still do not know how to protect people from HIV . Over the last year we have moved therefore from care support to urgent training of Romanian people who can then become effective educators . In 1990/ 91 we carried forward a substantial reserve which allowed us to meet greater than expected demands . In recognition of the importance of our work , I am pleased to report that our Central Government grant was increased last year to �140,00 with guaranteed funding for the next three years . In addition , local boroughs and health authorities fund us through grants and service contracts . The balance of funding has come from trusts , companies , churches and individuals . Despite these commitments , the last quarter was a difficult time with the recession and the changes in local government financing both having their effects . However , we are able to enter the 1991/ 92 financial year with a firm financial base , a strong management team and a greater than ever determination to be an effective caring Christian response to this global epidemic wherever it is most needed . ACET LONDON : HOME CARE SERVICE COMMUNITY CARE FOR THOSE DYING WITH AIDS " You can be perfectly well with HIV but at other times it 's hard to do even basic things . In the early days the stigma of being HIV positive drove away 60 % of my circle of friends . Despite the publicity on transmission of the disease , ignorance was such that they became afraid to even visit me . It soon became clear that I could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores , like shopping and housework , when I needed it . I contacted ACET who I knew provided practical care at home . " " Illness , including chronic muscle debility , herpes , tremors and eye infections have come and gone . Recently I have experienced near fatal fevers . Every day is an effort . That 's the reality ; you want life to be as it was . But without the help of ACET and other voluntary organisations I would not have been able to maintain my independence . " Three quarters of the nation 's entire AIDS problem is to be found in London and the pattern of need is changing fast . As London 's largest independent provider of community care we have seen these changes unfold at first hand . Between 1984 and 1986 , those with AIDS died on average some ten months after diagnosis , but by 1987 to 1989 , the survival period had already doubled to twenty months . Today , each person with AIDS is surviving on average longer than two years , needing more care than ever before . AIDS deaths : April 1990 -- March 1991 totalled 430 in four Thames regions ( CDSC figures April 1991 ) of which 15-20 ( estimated ) died outside M25 area . Our London Home Care service saw 103 deaths in the same area . British Medical Journal ( Source : BMJ 1991 ) ; 302 : 203-7 ) The " cause of death figures " are also changing beyond all recognition . In 1986 , the classical pneumocystis pneumonia used to be the final event in the disease process in almost half ( 46 % ) of AIDS related deaths . While pneumonia continues to be a common occurrence , by 1989 improved treatment had reduced the numbers dying as a result to only 3 % . Instead , people are developing other problems are developing other problems such as cancers which give rise to the need for long-term community support . British Medical Journal ( Source : BMJ 1991 ) ; 302 : 203-7 ) These factors help to explain why the total number of clients covered at any one time by our London 24 hour on-call service more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to 150 by March 1991 ; and why the provision of service has had to become so much more sophisticated . For example the numbers needing opiates to control pain are rising and up to one in five will need special battery-operated syringe pumps to deliver medication in the home . Over the next twelve months we expect a further increase in those needing our Home Care service to enable them to live and die at home . P. Dixon , Postgraduate Medical Journal ( in paper No 17/ Napp July 1991 ) . Help to stay at home : Nursing and medical advice Pain and symptom control 24 hour on-call Practical volunteer help ? Nightsitting Specialist equipment loan Emotional support The commonest cause of death now is advanced Kaposi 's Sarcoma -- a painful cancer . Slowly growing lesions can produce difficulties in the lung and the gut , causing many problems including shortness of breath , and periods of continuous pain . ACET SCOTLAND : " WHO WILL CARE FOR MY CHILDREN WHEN I DIE ? " It is hard to fathom the pain felt at the death of a son or daughter , husband or wife , partner or friend . But it is a pain that many families are having to live with as the number of those dying of AIDS increases . We already support over 70 children from the families we visit . Over the last year ACET 's centres in Dundee , Edinburgh and Glasgow have been asked to care for a growing number needing practical help to stay at home . In addition to illness , homelessness is a key issue . Often entire families including young children need practical home care , continuing if necessary after mum or dad has died . CHILDREN WITH HIV One of the saddest aspects of AIDS is the plight of children infected with HIV . For many families in Scotland , homecare plays a big part in alleviating some of the huge problems the face . Two out of five ACET clients in Scotland are women and therefore we anticipate an increase in the number of children needing care . We already support over 70 children who belong to the families we visit . Practical support in the home means that family members may not have to spend so long in hospital . Families can stay together through an extremely difficult period -- but this can only happen if organisations like ACET are sufficiently funded . YOU CA N'T PROVIDE HOMECARE TO THE HOMELESS In other cases people do n't even have homes to lose . Men and women discharged from hospital with nowhere to live , or released from prison back into the community , are having to sleep rough or doss down wherever they can find a willing friend . It is hard for those wanting to make a fresh start , maintain good health and stay off drugs . Although we are often successful in securing accommodation , it is a problem which stretches our resources to the full and we are urgently raising money to buy emergency short term accommodation for people with HIV/ AIDS . PREVENTING NEW INFECTION In Scotland the AIDS problem is largely drug related with HIV spreading rapidly through the communal use of syringes and needles during the mid 1980s . As a result there is now a large group who are at a similar stage of HIV infection at any one time . ACET is in touch with around 300 infected individuals of which about 130 need support to stay at home . Drug use is an emotive issue . But for many people , the slide into drug use has been to escape other problems -- poor living conditions , no real job prospects and broken relationships at home which all lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair . People are still injecting and sharing dirty equipment . ACET 's response has been to provide clients with special tubes for the disposal of dirty needles and syringes or help them if they wish to cease injecting . To help reduce infection , our community care workers also provide clean needles and syringes to those clients who are known injectors -- an operation which has full medical supervision . We also educate young people in schools about the dangers of drug use . Over the next decade a real challenge will be the effective provision of care for children and families affected by HIV/ AIDS . Ultimately death itself may be seen as a release . However the process of dying can be marred by guilt and rejection . On the other hand it can bring about reconciliation between families and friends and a new appreciation of life 's true values . ACET EDUCATION : AIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS Every day , despite massive health campaigns , thousands of young people are still taking serious risks . Tragically , more are becoming HIV infected , and many of those we care for with AIDS today were infected as teenagers . With many sexually active before their sixteenth birthday and with drug taking on the increase , education needs to start young . AIDS is a sensitive area which many schools are unsure how to tackle . But if we are to reduce the number of new infections and protect our young people , they must be given the facts about AIDS/ HIV and given the opportunity to discuss the issues openly . ACET is in a unique position to meet the need by carrying a high impact message aimed at changing high risk behaviour . Videos and literature are not enough . Official materials and guidelines do not always find favour with parents and governors . Very often they are pleased to invite ACET in as a church-based agency . Our educators present a personal message , each one having had experience of caring for those dying with AIDS at home . Furthermore our work in Uganda and Romania adds a wider perspective . The content of each lesson is agreed beforehand in consultation with teachers so it can be tailored to the priorities and individual needs of the school or class . Prejudices are challenged and myths exposed -- for example that only homosexual men and drug users are at risk . Pupils are encouraged to consider how they might feel if they were carrying the virus and how they might care for people with HIV/ AIDS , especially those with unfamiliar lifestyles . Over the last year , 24,000 pupils attended ACET class presentations , as against 14,500 in 1989/ 90 . The aim of our schools programme is quite simple ; to reduce the number of new infections and to encourage positive attitudes towards those with AIDS . An educator only has to prevent one new HIV infection a year to save the NHS his or her entire salary in future AIDS treatment costs alone . Our programme has been extended to parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland making it the largest of its kind in the UK . We hope to be able to increase its reach even further in the coming year . HIV/ AIDS education is placed in the context of lifeskills or health education -- the most common slot is " personal and social education " . Our latest schools booklet has been enthusiastically received by many pupils and teachers . In a follow-up survey , the great majority rated it the best AIDS resource they had seen . This is one lesson that could save their lives . ACET OVERSEAS : THE RACE AGAINST TIME In Constanta , alone , there are over 550 children with AIDS . By the year 2000 , of the 40 million expected to be infected with the virus causing AIDS , 36 million will be in the developing world . The global dimension of AIDS requires individual organisations and communities to rapidly develop their own local approaches and responses to the problem although often with limited resources . Seven million are already HIV infected in sub-Saharan Africa , increasing by over one million a year . Our work in the African continent centres on Uganda and is supported by Tear Fund . We also have a community care and education programme in Tanzania . UGANDA In Uganda , the number of people estimated to be HIV infected is 1.3 million , representing over 1 in 8 of the entire adult population . Indicates are that this figure is continuing to rise . There is a great deal of individual suffering with deaths in almost every family in some areas . ACET aims to be a practical resource to local churches and Christian organisations seeking to prevent new infection and provide basic community care . Over the next twelve months we will be providing support to a growing number of new and existing local programmes , identified as a result of an extensive survey we have just completed . There is an urgent need for further prevention work . Practical help is also needed for those who are dying and for orphans left behind . Uganda is a developing country with neither the wealth nor the health service infrastructure to cope with the problem adequately . ROMANIA -- CHANGING OLD HABITS It is well known that many children in Romanian hospitals have been infected with HIV through reused needles , syringes and infected blood transfusions . In Constanta alone there are over 550 children with AIDS . Adults are also infected . Last year ACET provided urgently needed medical supplies to the worst affected areas . We were also invited by the Chief Inspector of Preventative Medicine in Brasov to hold and HIV/ AIDS Health Education course for doctors , nurses and teachers in the Brasov district . At the same time we appointed a Romanian , Ana Ureche , to coordinate and represent our work . The aim of the course was primarily to train Health Educators , who in turn can train others in hospitals , schools and communities , reducing the risk of further infection . Our first and subsequent courses have been a success and are part of a long-term commitment to AIDS prevention . In the future we hope also to be able to assist further with practical care . ACET is involved in the planning and implementation of a Mobile Home Care project with the Church of Ireland Missionary Society and Diocese of Mwanza , funded by WHO . This will help prevent the spread of infection in local Tanzanian villages as well as provide basic community care . The Romanian Government , WHO and UNICEF have taken a great interest in our education programme and are actively looking for ways to use it as a model for Health Education in Romania .

It is not yet clear how many of the almost 80 other prisoners freed at the same time were held for political reasons . Thoza Khonje , a 43-year-old area sugar company manager , was arrested on 28 February 1989 , reportedly after being overheard criticizing policy decisions by Life-President Hastings Kamazu Banda . George Mtafu , Malawi 's only neurosurgeon , was arrested the same month after refusing to apologise for challenging public criticisms of northern Malawians made by Life-President Banda . Other northern Malawians arrested between February and May 1989 are thought to be among those set free . Others freed included William Masiku , detained since 1980 , Brown Mmpinganjira , detained since 1986 , Margaret Marango Banda , detained since 1988 , and Blaise Machira , also detained since 1988 . The releases mark the first improvement in the human rights situation in Malawi for several years . however , other prominent prisoners of conscience remain behind bars . For example , Goodluck Mhango , a veterinary surgeon arrested in September 1987 , has been rejected for release by a committee established to review the cases of political detainees . Amnesty International has welcomed the releases , but is urging the government to release all remaining prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally . Swaziland Five prisoners of conscience held in Swaziland since November 1990 under renewable 60-day administrative detention orders were released on 22 March 1991 . The five were previously imprisoned from June until October 1990 for allegedly organizing a political party -- all parties are prohibited . The releases occurred shortly before two AI representatives arrived in Swaziland for talks with the government . Mauritania In April AI called on the Mauritanian Government to investigate reports that up to 200 political prisoners had died or been killed in military or police custody -- some executed without trial and many others as a result of torture . The victims were among some 3,000 black Mauritanians arrested late last year . The authorities claimed they were conspiring to overthrow the government , which is dominated by a different community , the Moors , but offered no evidence to substantiate this claim . It took AI several months to compile details of the killings , but prisoners released in March 1991 provided information and themselves bore scars from torture . In a few cases , prisoners are reported to have been deliberately executed without trial . Most of the reported deaths , however , were due to torture in both military barracks and police stations . Torture of political detainees in Mauritania has been routine since 1986 , but it has never before been used on such a scale . After the March 1991 releases , over 70 detainees were still held and were apparently due to be brought to trial in April . However , the trial has been postponed indefinitely . Mali Over 150 men , women and children were killed by Mali 's security forces in March , after a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations and riots . In the wake of the killings the government led by President Moussa Traor� was overthrown . At least 40 people were killed in Bamako on 22 March after a student demonstration was stopped by the security forces and rioting broke out . A state of emergency was declared but at least another 40 people were killed the following day . Some were shot dead when thousands of women , protesting against the killings , tried to march on the President 's residence . Up to 65 protesters were reported to have been burned to death when security forces set fire to a shopping centre in which they were seeking refuge . Soldiers also shot at mourners burying the dead at two cemeteries in Bamako . Amnesty International called on the Malian Government to halt the killings . Following a general strike and calls for his resignation , the President was arrested on 26 March by fellow army officers . Some 50 others associated with the former government were also detained . The authorities promised early elections , and said the former president and others arrested would be brought to trial . Rwanda Amnesty International has received information about nearly 300 Ugandan nationals currently detained for political reasons in Rwanda . They have not been charged or tried and may be imprisoned because of their nationality , in retaliation for the Ugandan authorities alleged support of the armed opposition group , the Rwandese Patriotic Front . Relatives and friends of a man shot dead during pro-democracy demonstrations in Bamako , with the body in a hospital morgue . AMERICAS Guatemala In a breakthrough case on 20 March this year , four policemen in Guatemala City were convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old street child and sentenced to between 10 and 15 years ' imprisonment . Naham�n Carmona L�pez was attacked by the four policemen on 4 March 1990 in Guatemala City . He died in hospital several days later of multiple injuries , including a ruptured liver , six fractured ribs , two broken fingers and severe bruising to 70 per cent of his body . ( See Amnesty Oct/ Nov 1990 ) . The four members of the National Police were arrested in June 1990 . At their trial , the judge is believed to have added 25 per cent to each sentence specifically because the police had carried out the attack while operating in their official capacity . In April AI learned that warrants had been issued for the arrest of two police officers and a civilian in connection with the killing of 17-year-old Anstraum Aman Villagr�n Morales . Anstraum Villagr�n was shot and killed on 25 June 1990 in Guatemala City by two uniformed police officers . The three are also believed to be implicated in other cases of serious violations against street children . Thirty-six other lawsuits against 35 National Police officers , three Treasury Police officers , 10 civilians and three judges for a wide range of abuses against street children are reportedly pending in Guatemalan courts . A BBC1 Everyman programme entitled " They Shoot Children Do n't They ? " screened in January this year focussed on the plight of the children . The producers worked closely with an AI researcher and concentrated on the work of Bruce Harris , a human rights worker in Guatemala . Viewers wishing to help were given the address of AI at the end of the programme : over 1,500 letters were subsequently received at the AI office . In response , AI sent out information packs on the case of Naham�n and people to write letters to the relevant authorities . With letters still coming in , AI will be sending out information on other street children 's cases in Guatemala -- many of Naham�n 's friends who witnessed the attack have been subjected to harassment from the police . Brazil A proposal for constitutional reform to allow a national plebiscite on the reintroduction of the death penalty in Brazil , for kidnappings , burglaries and rapes resulting in the victim 's death , was approved by a Congressional Commission of the House of Deputies in December 1990 . AI has appealed to Brazilian parliamentarians expressing its concern over the moves to reinstate the death penalty . The death penalty was excluded from the Brazilian Penal Code in 1890 and its abolition is enshrined in the 1988 Constitution . El Salvador Death squad killings , " disappearances " , illegal arrests and torture persist in spite of the Government and the Farabund Marti National Liberation Front signing the Agreement on Human Rights in July 1990 , under the auspices of the United Nations . At least nine people were killed between November 1990 and January 1991 by death squads linked to the Armed Forces . Some of the bodies showed signs of torture and in many cases personal documents had been removed to prevent identification . There have also been some reports of " disappearances " following arrests by the military or police since July 1990 . Of particular concern is the pattern of abductions by armed men in plain clothes in security force style operations , most of which took place at night . Amnesty has received repeated reports of violation of detention procedures . Military units have frequently carried out arrests and failed promptly to hand over detainees to the police -- a number have been held beyond the 72-hour-limit . Torture is still being used to intimidate detainees . Peru AI has appealed to President Alberto Fujimori for a prompt investigation into a bomb attack on Dr Augusto Z��iga opened a letter bomb which blew off his left hand and forearm . At the time , Dr. Z��iga was working on the case of student Ernesto Castillo P�ez , who " disappeared " after he was reportedly detained by police on 21 October 1990 in Lima . The case received wide publicity when a habeas corpus petition was upheld by two lower courts . However , the Supreme Court subsequently annulled the habeas corpus on grounds of procedural irregularites . Dr. Z��iga was warned that the police might seek reprisals against him , but although he informed the authorities of this , novo specific measures of protection were apparently offered to him . ASIA People 's Republic of China As AI launched a campaign in March 1991 against the extensive use of the death penalty in China , a nationwide drive to crack down on crime continued unabated . AI has recorded a bout 100 death sentences each month since the beginning of 1991 . During 1990 AI recorded almost 1,000 death sentences , of which at least 750 resulted in executions . In the official press , Chinese politicians , as well as senior members of the judiciary , have repeatedly urged that instructions to " punish criminals heavily and rapidly " be strictly adhered to . Some prisoners who would not normally have received the death sentence may have fallen victim to political interference in the judicial process . Increased official emphasis on speedy investigation and sentencing in death penalty cases is likely to have further undermined the rights of defendants to a fair trial . On 14 March 24-year-old Han Weijun was executed . He had first been found guilty of setting fire to an armoured personnel carrier commandeered by students and a car during the 19898 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing . His was the first reported execution in several months for an offence related to the " counter-revolutionary rebellion " . A court notice reported the economic loss of the two vehicles , but did not mention any military casualties . The death penalty is routinely used in China for serious economic crimes which involve no personal violence . Afghanistan Hundreds of Afghan political prisoners have reportedly been held without charge or trial for up to nine years in interrogation centres and segregated prison blocks operated by the Ministry of State Security . In a recent report , AI called on the Afghan Government to end the torture and long-term detention without trial of political prisoners . The detainees include individuals suspected of involvement in armed opposition or non-violent anti-government activity . They are initially held in isolation cells for periods lasting as long as several months . During their isolation , they are reportedly denied access to legal counsel and family visits and are at risk of systematic torture and ill-treatment . Sri Lanka Two AI delegates were recently invited as guest speakers to a week-long conference in Colombo on trade unions and human rights . The delegates met several senior government officials and discussed possibilities for future access by AI to Sri Lanka . AI was last permitted access to the country in 1982 . Among those the delegates met were the Adviser to the President on International Affairs , the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence , the Inspector General of Police , and the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation . The government subsequently announced to the press that " a research visit to Sri Lanka would be considered favourably if a formal request were made " by AI . Taiwan In the April/ May letter writing campaign , there was an error in the appeal on behalf of Taiwanese prisoner Huang Hua . As there is no Embassy of Taiwan in the UK , please do not copy any appeals to another embassy , as proposed on the letter writing page . We apologise sincerely for this clerical error , and regret the confusion and inconvenience it has caused . Indonesia More than 130 political prisoners from Irian Jaya are currently serving lengthy prison terms for advocating the province 's independence from Indonesia . Most have been convicted since 1988 under Indonesia 's sweeping Anti-Subversion Law , accused of attempting to establish an independent state of " West Papua " . Amnesty International believes that their trials were unfair . The organization has already adopted two of the prisoners as prisoners of conscience and believes that some 80 others may be POCs . Among the possible prisoners of conscience are 37 people sentenced to up to 20 years ' imprisonment for their involvement in a peaceful flag-raising ceremony in the town of Jayapura on 14 December 1988 . A woman alleged to have sewn the flag was sentenced to eight years in prison and her husband , who led the ceremony , to 20 years . In 1990 a police officer accused of distributing copies of a patriotic song to high-school students was sentenced to 13 years ' imprisonment by a military court . Four men who allegedly planned demonstrations in December 1989 to commemorate the 1988 flag-raising , were sentenced to terms of between six and 12 years . In addition to imprisonment , those believed to have advocated Irian Jaya 's independence , whether through peaceful or violent means , continue to be at risk of torture , ill-treatment , " disappearance " , and extrajudicial execution by Indonesian security forces . This pattern of human rights violations is described in a recent AI report , Indonesia : Continuing Human Rights Violations in Irian Jaya , available from the British Section office . EUROPE UN Commission on Human Rights After two years of taking no action in response to reports of grave and widespread violations in Iraq , the Commission on Human Rights has appointed a Special Rapporteur to investigate the human rights situation there ; another special Rapporteur has been appointed to examine violations committed by Iraqi forces in occupied Kuwait . The Commission also took a stronger stand in respect of two other countries on its agenda : Cuba will not come under special scrutiny by a representative of the UN Secretary-General and the Expert on Equatorial Guinea , a country which receives assistance under the UN Advisory Services Program , has been requested to study the human rights situation there . Another significant development to emerge from the latest session of the Commission , held in March 1991 , was its decision to establish a Working Group on arbitrary detention . This will be the first UN mechanism with a clear mandate to examine cases of detained prisoners of conscience anywhere in the world . It will fill an important gap in the framework of protection established by the Commission 's existing " theme mechanisms " on " disappearances " , torture and summary or arbitrary executions . However , it was disappointing that a new international instrument on " disappearances " was held over for further study . Another new instrument that the Commission will be considering next year is a revised draft of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture , which would set up an international system of visits to places of detention , aimed at preventing torture and ill-treatment . The Commission kept under review the human rights situation in Afghanistan , Romania , El Salvador and Iran but sent a clear signal that it may terminate special scrutiny of the latter two countries at its next session . It decided to transfer Haiti to the Advisory Services Program and also to keep Guatemala under this program for a further year despite AI 's appeals for stronger measures . Turkey A new " Anti-Terror Law " , which combines a number of new provisions for the investigation and trial of persons suspected of acts of political violence or association with violent political opposition groups , was approved by President Ozal on 17 April . This law includes amendments to the penal code and the conditional release of approximately 38,000 prisoners . Most of those released are non-political prisoners convicted of criminal offences , but a number of prisoners of conscience will also be released . Many political prisoners who had been sentenced to death or life imprisonment after unfair trials following the 1980 coup will continue to serve sentences of up to 20 years . Amnesty warmly welcomed the release of prisoners of conscience and the repeal of certain articles , but has urged that the legislation be extended to include reform or repeal of further articles of the Turkish Penal Code , under which POCs may be held . The new law may in fact increase the already serious risk of torture facing political detainees . Suspected torturers are permitted under the new law to continue to interrogate detainees while charges against them are outstanding . Police officers who have taken statements from detainees will also be exempted from being questioned in court unless they agree to do so , making it difficult for detainees to challenge the validity of any confessions made under torture . There has been a marked increase in reports of deaths as a result of torture in Turkish police stations . Nine such cases have been reported to AI since 25 November 1990 . USSR Statistics on the death penalty in the USSR have been made public for the first time since 1934 . Figures on its use from 1985 to 1989 were announced by the Minister of Justice at a press conference on 16 January 1991 . These show a progressive decrease in death sentences from 770 in 1985 , of which 20 were commuted , to 271 in 1988 with 72 commutations . The 1989 figures indicate a reversal of this trend with 276 death setences passed and a sharp reduction of commutations to 23 . The 1990 figures , provided more recently by the Ministry of Justice , show a dramatic increase to 447 death sentences , mostly for murder under aggravating circumstances . The same source reports that 190 executions took place last year . AI welcomes the publication of statistics on the death penalty , as well as current proposals to limit its scope . However , it remains concerned that there has been no stay on sentences or executions pending the review of existing legislation . 15 villagers including three minors were killed and 19 others , including several children , wounded when soldiers opened fire on a crowd of unarmed people on 2/ 12/ 90 . Well-known broadcaster and journalist Richard de Zoysa was abducted and murdered in February 1990 .

MIDDLE EAST Iraq In April AI appealed to the Iraqi Government in the strongest possible terms to put an immediate end to the mass deliberate killing of unarmed civilians and the summary execution of government opponents and their suspected supporters . The appeal followed numerous reports that Iraqi Government forces were committing these and other human rights violations following the recapture of cities and town in the northern Kurdish and southern Shi'a areas of the country . Many Kurds and Arab Shi'a Muslims were reportedly deliberately killed by Iraqi forces as they fled to Iran , Turkey and the then US-occupied region of southern Iraq . In its appeal AI also expressed dismay at reports that Iraqi Kurds who returned to Arbil in northern Iraq following a government announcement of an amnesty for Kurds on 5 April were arbitrarily arrested , summarily executed or subjected to forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . AI also sent urgent appeals to the governments of the United States , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in April , urging them to ensure that Iraqi refugees then under the control of United States-led coalition forces were guaranteed effective and durable protection against human rights violations by Iraqi Government forces . AI stated that it strongly feared that the refugee population would be at risk of certain torture , " disappearance " or execution if returned to Iraqi Government control . Kuwait A public appeal to the Emir of Kuwait to intervene personally to end the wave of arbitrary arrests , torture and killings in the country since the withdrawal of Iraqi forces , was issued on 19 April by Amnesty International . Reporting back after a two-week visit to Kuwait , an AI fact-finding team said scores of victims had been killed and hundreds more had been arbitrarily arrested , many brutally tortured by Kuwaiti armed forces and members of " resistance " groups since 26 February . On the highly publicized issue in AI 's December report of the baby deaths , Amnesty said that although its team was shown alleged mass graves of babies , it was not established how they had died and the team found no reliable evidence that Iraqi forces had caused the deaths of babies by removing them or ordering their removal from incubators . The plight of some 600 detainees acknowledged by the authorities was also giving cause for concern . They had been held in the Military Prison outside Kuwait City , some for over a month , reportedly in deplorable conditions . Medical care was virtually non-existent , food and water often withheld , and torture rife . The authorities were not granting full access to detainees by independent bodies , such as the International committee of the Red Cross , and relatives were not being informed of detainees ' whereabouts . As a result , the fate of many victims remained unknown . Tunisia Dozens of people are reported to have been tortured while held incommunicado in prolonged garde � vue detention by the Tunisian police since January 1991 . Garde � vue detention allows the police to detain suspects for interrogation for a period of up to 10 days . Recent information from former detainees , lawyers and human rights activists indicates that suspected political opponents of the government , including boys under 18 , have been detained in garde � vue well beyond the maximum 10-day period and without obtaining further authorization after four days as required by Tunisian law . AI is concerned that the Tunisian Government , by its failure to investigate allegations of torture brought to its notice , appears to be condoning the use of torture . AI welcomed the formation by the Tunisian Government of an official human rights council on 9 April 1991 , although the organization remained concerned at continuing reports of torture and ill-treatment of political detainees in garde � vue detention . Bahrain On 9 May AI published Bahrain : Violations of human rights . The report describes how in recent years hundreds of political activists or suspected activists , including prisoners of conscience , have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and torture and sentenced after unfair trials . Many are held for months or years in administrative or pretrial detention , usually incommunicado . It is during this time that torture most commonly occurs . Some detainees have been held for as long as seven years without charge or trial . AI has repeatedly called on the Bahraini Government to ratify and implement international human rights treaties as a matter of urgency . Saudi Arabia Salih al-'Azzaz , a prominent writer and journalist , was released uncharged on 4 March . In November 1990 he had been arrested in connection with a protest by women in Riyadh against a ban on women drivers . He was held in solitary confinement in the General Intelligence headquarters in Riyadh and was reportedly tortured . He had previously been arrested in May 1982 , when he was editor-in-chief of al-Yawm newspaper , and was held without charge or trial until he was released following an amnesty at the end of 1982 .

MA in human rights A new MA degree in human rights is being offered by the University of Essex . Unique in the UK , and probably in the world , the MA is a one-year course beginning in October 1991 . It is intended both for those who want to do practical or legal work for human rights organizations , and for those who would find it an outstanding preparation for research degrees in Law , Philosophy and Politics . Best Cards in the Biz Amnesty has been given Greetings Magazine 's " Best Charity Card of the Year " award . This award was presented to Amnesty International following the decision of an independent panel of judges drawn from members of the public nationwide and chaired by a representative from the greetings card industry . The design itself was commissioned by Trading Officer Craig Methven and painted by Sheila Moxley , who has designed Amnesty 's 1992 Human Rights Calendar . Free at last ! BBC2 TV " Prisoners of conscience series Nov/ Dec 1990 -- update As in previous years the response to the " prisoners of Conscience " programmes shown on the BBC in November/ December 1990 has been tremendous and effective , and we are still answering 10 enquiries a week about prisoners . In addition we are still receiving enquiries about prisoners featured in the first two series in 1988 and 1989 , and we have recently received a copy of a letter from Alattin Sahin , the Turkish prisoner of conscience in the 1988 , which someone has received on his release . The programmes , which this year featured 19 prisoners of conscience or " disappearances " , received 15,000 phone calls and letters . All those who have written to the prisoners will be pleased to know that Henrick Gjoka from Albania , Reverend Lawford Imunde from Kenya and Ernesto Diaz Rodriguez from Cuba have been released . Hong Song-dam from South Korea has had his prison sentence reduced while Khalid el Kid from Sudan has been moved to Kober Prison , Khartoum , Sudan .

GLOBAL WARNING No matter where in the world human rights violations occur -- from India to Iran , Chile to Czechoslovakia -- Amnesty International is there to warn the world . In this , its 300th anniversary year , its role as human rights watchdog is as vital now as ever it was . By Norma Johnston Santiago , Chile : On a warm autumn evening in 1990 international rock star Sting dances on stage with a group of Chilean mothers and grandmothers of the " disappeared " . The event , organized by the Chilean Section of Amnesty International , is entitled " An Embrace of Hope " . Moscow , USSR : At the same time , 12,000 miles away , a delegation from Amnesty 's International Secretariat is making plans for a fledgling Moscow Group to participate in the Women in the Front Line campaign . To outsiders , the two events may seem little more than an international organization at work , but for Amnesty members these events are charged with significance . The Cold War was at its height when Peter Benenson , the British lawyer , founded Amnesty , and three decades later it is hard to believe that the Moscow AI Group finally has permission to become part of Soviet life . Similarly , the idea that a human rights concert should be held in the very stadium in Santiago where Allende 's officers rounded up thousands of Chileans in 1973 , prior to committing gross violations , stretches the powers of credulity . But incredulous , or not , the events happened ( millions of television viewers worldwide watched the Chilean concert ) and as such they typify the massive changes that Amnesty has undergone in its 30-year history . Sadly , one thing has not changed in 30 years : certain governments of the world still falsely imprison , torture and execute their citizens , regardless of internationally agreed standards that expressly forbid such abuses . Around the world today , more than 100 countries still retain the death penalty , and two out of every three human beings live under governments that use torture and other cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment against them . For this reason the campaigning elements of the organization -- and that includes many of the 80,000 British members who undertake to be active on Amnesty 's behalf -- have increased and refined their methods over the years . In practical terms this means that although letter-writing to governments regarding prisoners continues to be the cornerstone of the campaign work other methods have been introduced to enhance the effectiveness of the hundreds of thousands of letters that Amnesty members write each year . The Regional Action Network illustrates how campaigners have refined their methods . Members working on behalf of a prisoner learn a lot about that country -- its culture and political allegiance for example -- knowledge that is no longer useful when the case is closed . Such knowledge could , however , continue to be useful when used in a regional context , which is what the RANs do , enabling members to react to a wider range of human rights violations in any given region . At group level , the days have gone when three prisoners per group ( one from the West , the East and a non-aligned country ) were obligatory . Nowadays , impartiality need not be expressed quite so crudely , and a look at any group 's case load will show that a balance is always maintained . In the 1961 Observer article that launched Amnesty , Benenson listed the aims of the organization . They included : " to enlarge the Right of Asylum and help political refugees to find work . " Adherence to this stated principle has never faltered , but other areas of concern took precedence and it was not until the late 1970s that this area of work was developed . In 1985 work on behalf of refugees took its place in the statute of Amnesty . The British Section refugee office has played a leading role in this area of work , processing some 4,000 cases since 1980 . The public perception of Amnesty has also changed and this has not happened by accident . For a long time deemed a white , Western organization , the setting up of section sin countries like Tunisia , Algeria and South Korea , are ample illustration of Amnesty 's worldwide stature . As a multi-lingual movement the human rights message can be conveyed via dozens of reports , books and audio-visual materials to audiences from Japan to Nigeria . Amnesty is global in name and nature . The very life blood of Amnesty is its research teams -- there are currently 40 based at the International Secretariat in London . Things have changed for them too , says Anne Burley , Head of Europe Region at the IS . " I joined Amnesty in 1968 when there were n't any teams or even research regions . In those days there was a small core of paid research staff who were responsible for a large number of countries -- if you did the Soviet Union , you were also responsible for Eastern Europe and half of Western Europe as well ! " Volunteers worked on research alongside their paid counterparts and Burley recalls the hundreds of Spanish and Portuguese POCs on whose behalf Amnesty worked at that time . Of course , none of the work carried out by Amnesty could continue without money and it is in this respect that sections , particularly the larger sections like the British , have a vital role to play . The annual budget for 1990 was �11 million , which represents only a third of the money raised worldwide on Amnesty 's behalf . It excludes the contributions made by individuals who finance the sending of telexes and telegrams as well as the funds required to support national sections . Professional fundraisers utilize the powerful medium of advertising in their national press , an advertisement issued by the British Section in autumn 1990 about Iraq 's treatment of Kurds and its human rights record over a decade , was the most successful advertisement ever run by the Section . It recruited 4,000 new members and raised �70,000 . Add to this the monies raised by new members the length and breadth of the British Isles who contributed to the Section 's annual turnover of �2.25 million with their cultural events , sponsored walks and street collections . From a handful of POCs in the early Sixties , the number of cases taken up by Amnesty now stands at 42,000 of which 38,000 are now closed . Full-scale Amnesty sections are now operational in 44 countries , with active groups in another 16 , and a total membership of more than one million spread across 150 countries . The list of laws that have been amended , the treaties that have been ratified , and prisoners ' conditions that have been improved is a long one . However , it is not long enough . In the years since 1961 , Eastern European dictators have come and gone , moves afoot in South Africa hold hope for the future , and countries abolishing the death penalty are on the increase . Globally however , much work lies ahead . In Benenson 's words : " The gradual change over the last 30 years in the public perception of the value of human life is a measure of Amnesty 's influence . But we will not have finished until cruelty , be it killing or torture , is seen as obscene and impermissible .

FREEDOM COME AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE 92 PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE FEATURED IN THE LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGN IN 1989 AND 1990 -- 39 ARE NOW FREE ! In 1962 AI 's first ever journal had good news on its front page . A prisoner of conscience had been freed in Spain . A Christmas card sent to him by an AI member in Switzerland had been returned marked " Consigned is free " . Since then , every issue of the journal has published appeals for the release of other prisoners of conscience . Many of these prisoners are now free . Some have thanked AI , but we take no credit for anyone 's freedom . We know from experience that many factors -- some of which may never be apparent to outside observers -- determine whether a prisoner of conscience is released . Today the terrible injustice done to those prisoners reaches a mass audience . Amnesty sections all over the world include the Prisoner Letter Writing Campaign cases in the magazines and newssheets they publish in many other languages , from Faroe to Banlga . In many countries , regional and national newspapers report on these prisoner cases -- the Slovenian Catholic weekly Druzina , the French national daily Le Monde , and the Pakistani daily The Muslim , to name but a few . Year in , year out , the Prisoner Letter Writing Campaign provides a unique window into the harsh and desperate world of the prisoner of conscience . Hundreds of thousands of people have appealed for their freedom . And the prisoners themselves know that they are not alone , that the world has not forgotten them . The 1990s began with a dramatic upturn of the fortunes of thousands of prisoners of conscience across eastern and central Europe . In Czechoslovakia former prisoner of conscience Vaclav Havel became President of his country . In many of these countries the new respect for human rights was embodied in the repeal or revision of laws used to imprison prisoners of conscience . But there are still prisoners of conscience in Europe , and in every other region of the world . 39 of the prisoners featured in the letter writing campaign have been released ; about 50 remain in prison . None of these people should ever have been prisoners of conscience . Our task today is to increase the international pressure on behalf of the thousands of prisoners of conscience all over the world , to make tomorrow the day their freedom is restored . Africa Francisco Bonifacio Mba Nguema remains in prison in Equatorial Guinea . He is serving a 20-year sentence imposed in 1988 by a military court which found him guilty of attempting to overthrow the government . Hew was convicted on the basis of confessions he had made under torture and because he had read The Dogs of War , a novel about a coup in an imaginary country widely thought to be based on Equatorial Guinea . In Kenya Harris Okong'o Arara continues to serve a five-year sentence imposed in 1988 under a law which makes it a criminal offence simply to possess literature critical of the government . Mulugetta Mosissa , a former civil servant , remains in detention without trial in Ethiopia . He was arrested in 1980 , with hundreds of other members of the Oromo ethnic group who were suspected of links with an Oromo guerilla group . Although many of these detainees were released in 1989 , including Mulugetta 's wife and son , he is one of 50 still held .

Tarcisio Medina Charry , a 21-year-old student , " disappeared " after being arrested in 1988 . A judicial investigation into his case ordered the arrest of a member of the national police .

Asia Alexander Warouw and Manan Effendi have been imprisoned in Indonesia since 1965 . Both in their 70s , they continue to serve life sentences imposed in connection with an abortive coup in that year which was blamed on the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Although both were linked to the PKI , there is no evidence that either of them had knowledge of the events leading to the coup . Their cases were featured in a British Section Christmas card campaign in 1990 and they received 1,704 cards as a result of the appeal . In early 1991 AI received a letter directly from the two men . They had copied out the names and addresses of everyone who wrote to them and enclosed the list with a message of thanks and good wishes , asking that it be sent on . Also in Indonesia , Agil Riyanto bin Darmowiyoto , a law student , continues to serve a 15-year sentence imposed for subversion in 1987 . He is one of a group of seven young Muslim activists in Brebes , Central Java , convicted on charges arising from their involvement in Muslim groups known as usroh , aiming to deepen awareness of Islamic teachings .

Their living conditions are harsh with poor provision of housing , food and medicines . The South Korean authorities wrote to AI in response to its appeals for imprisoned artist Hong Song-dam and publisher Chang Ui-gyun . The authorities said that Hong Song-dam was not imprisoned merely for sending his paintings to North Korea and books to Koreans in Germany , but because his paintings and contributions to a magazine Art Movement were aimed at promoting a Marxist-Leninist revolution . In September 1990 the Supreme Court dismissed the charges of espionage and returned the case to a lower court . In January 1991 Hong Song-dam was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment for producing material benefiting North Korea . Chang Ui-gyun continues to serve an eight-year sentence for espionage . The authorities denied that his arrest in 1987 was solely because he had met pro-North Korean people in Japan and claimed that he had acted on North Korean orders to collect documents on South Korean opposition groups , and to infiltrate dissent groups in order to create social unrest . They also stated that he had received funds from North Korea . AI had reviewed these accusations , but had found them unsubstantiated . Father Thadeus Nguyen Van Ly , a Roman Catholic priest in Viet Nam , was arrested in May 1983 after trying to organize an unauthorized pilgrimage .

In the Philippines , there have been some encouraging developments in the case of Zosimo Alpino . He was one of 25 farmers arrested in November 1987 and accused of membership of the New People 's Army ( NPA ) , the armed wing of the outlawed Communist Party . Zosimo Alpino was released on bail on 13 December 1990 .

DO N'T FORGET TO WRITE THE CRIMES THAT GOVERNMENTS COMMIT ARE AN OUTRAGE AGAINST ALL HUMANITY . BUT EVERY DAY WE HEAR THE SAME EXCUSES FROM GOVERNMENTS . THE VICTIMS DESERVE IT . THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS . MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS . TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE GOVERNMENTS STILL TORTURE THEIR OWN PEOPLE . Amnesty International does not want to hear any more excuses , from governments or from anybody else . The horrors must be stopped everywhere once and for all . Human rights can be won -- even against overwhelming odds . We have seen it happen . Change is possible . Amnesty International is launching its 30th Anniversary appeal for 30 prisoner cases around the world in 1991 . Tens of thousands of Amnesty members and supporters in over 100 countries will be writing letters to governments about these particular cases . Out of the list we have selected the following five cases for appeals by members of the British Section . Please write courteous letters to the heads of the governments indicated -- and let us know of any replies that you receive . MOROCCO MOHAMED SRIFI Sentenced to 30 years for his peaceful political views Write to : Tell the King that you are concerned about the case of Mohamed Srifi , currently in Kenitra Central Prison , Casablanca , who was arrested in 1974 , tortured , brought to trial in 1977 and jailed for 30 years after a blatantly unfair trial . He was accused of calling for the violent overthrow of the monarchy . Srifi was a member of a banned left wing group Ila'l-Amam ( Forward ) .

Orton Chirwa formed an opposition party in exile . The couple returned to Malawi in 1981 . The authorities claim they entered to try and overthrow the government . The Chirwas say they came to see a sick relative . They were tried , convicted of treason and sentenced to death , later commuted to life imprisonment . Tell the President that you have read about their case , that their trial was unfair -- even the Appeal Court agrees on this -- and ask that they are released immediately . PHILIPPINES MARIA NONNA SANTA CLARA " Disappeared " with a colleague while working for a community organization . Write to : Draw her attention to the case of ecumenical community worker Maria N.

His hands were manacled behind his back except when he ate or slept . Tell the President that you have read about Abd Al-Ru'uf 's allegation that he was tortured , and about his lawyer 's complaint . Ask for this claim to be investigated , and find out whether anyone has been found responsible and brought to justice . PRISONER LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGN Each of the people whose story follows is a prisoner of conscience . Each has been arrested because of his or her religious or political beliefs , colour , sex , ethnic origin or language . None has used or advocated violence . Their continuing detention is a violation of the United National Universal Declaration of Human Rights . International appeals can help to secure the release of these prisoners or to improve their detention conditions . In the prisoners ' case , letters to the authorities should be worded carefully and courteously . You should stress that your concern for human rights is not in any way politically partisan . In no circumstances should communications be sent to the prisoner . TUNISIA Hamadi Jebali : a 51-year-old newspaper editor from Sousse , he was sentenced by the military court in Tunis on 31 January 1991 to one year 's imprisonment for publishing an article calling for the abolition of military courts . The article , entitled " When will military courts , serving as special courts , be abolished ? " and written by a Tunisian lawyer , was published in 27 October 1990 in Al-Fajr ( Dawn ) , the official newspaper of the non-recognized Islamic group Hizb al-Nahda ( Renaissance ) . Hamadi Jebali was charged with defamation of a judicial institution under the Tunisian Press Code , under which prior authorization by the Ministry of Interior is required to publish any newspaper or periodical . The Press Code further requires that the first printed copy of each issue be submitted to the Ministry of Interior which can then intervene to stop distribution . The issue of Al-Fajr in which the article appeared was apparently approved by the Ministry of Interior . However , the Ministry of Defence decided to prosecute Hamadi Jebali . The Tunisian authorities ordered the newspaper Al-Fajr to close until further notice on 8 February 1991 . Hamadi Jebali 's sentence was confirmed on 6 March 1991 by the Cassation court . This is the only court of appeal for cases tried by the military court , and looks only at points of law and not at facts and findings , thus providing a restricted appeal . In October 1990 , Hamadi Jebali , who is a member of the executive council of Hizb al-Nahda , had received a six month 's suspended sentence and a fine of 1500 dinars for publishing an article entitled " The people of the State or the State of the people ? " in Al-Fajr in June 1990 . This sentence may be added to the new one-year term . Please send courteous letters appealing for his immediate and unconditional release to : MOROCCO Mohamed Abbad : a 37-year-old student and ex-president of the Union Nationale des Etudiants Marocains ( UNEM ) , National Union of Moroccan Students , he is serving a 15-year prison sentence in Safi Prison . Mohamed Abbad is one of 31 people tried in May 1984 in Marrakech following demonstrations in January 1984 against price rises and the imposition of an examination fee for the baccalaureate examination . They were reportedly arrested without warrant several days after the demonstrations , held incommunicado and tortured in garde � vue detention . Mohamed Abbad was sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment on charges including conspiracy to overthrow the government and possessing leaflets aimed at disturbing internal security . The prosecution 's evidence consisted of statements allegedly extracted under torture , and confiscated literature . He denied all the charges against him except possession of the literature which he said was either on sale in public bookstores or did not advocate violence . Mohamed Abbad remains in prison with 17 of the original 31 . He was originally held in Safi Prison , where he developed diabetes in 1988 , but was then transferred to Marrakech where his family lives , and so could visit him regularly and provide him with the food necessary for his diabetic diet . On 26 March 1991 he was returned to Safi Prison and in protest he began a hunger-strike which resulted in his falling into a coma , due to his illness , a few days later . He is now held in hospital in Safi . Please send courteous appealing for his release , if possible in French or Arabic to : PEOPLE 'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA People 's Republic of China Father Jin Dechen : the 71-year-old Catholic Vicar-General of Nanyang diocese , Henan Province , he was sentenced in July 1982 to 15 years ' imprisonment for " counterrevolutionary " offences . Fr Jin was first arrested in the late 1950s , when many Catholics were detained for proclaiming their loyalty to the Vatican . The detentions followed the formation of an official Patriotic Catholic Association ( PCA ) , independent of the Church of Rome , intended to bring Catholic affairs under the control of the Chinese Government . Fr Jin was released in 1973 , but kept under strict surveillance . He was arrested again in December 1981 . As well as maintaining his allegiance to Rome , Fr Jin is reported to have spoken out against government policies on contraception and abortion . The authorities are reportedly prepared to release Fr Jin if he appeals for clemency on grounds such as ill-health . Fr Jin has apparently refused -- he is in good health despite his age -- and is not prepared to admit to any criminal activity to secure his release . He is currently held at the No. 3 provincial prison at Yuxian in Henan . Please write courteous letters appealing for Fr Jin Dechen 's release to : CUBA Orlando Azcu� Rodriguez : a 33-year-old cigar factory technician , he is serving a three-year sentence for advocating free elections . Orlando Azcu� Rodriguez was arrested on 5 April 1990 in Havana and brought to trial on 12 October on charges of making " enemy propaganda " . He was found guilty and sentenced to three years ' imprisonment . Orlando Azcu� was one of 12 political prisoners in Combinado del Este Prison in Havana who signed a letter dated 1 January 1991 , calling for peaceful political change and respect for human rights , that was smuggled out of the prison . The 12 also refused to wear their prison uniform . As a result , they were transferred to different prisons . Orlando Azcu� and two others were taken to " Kilo 7 " Maximum Security Prison in Camaguey where , on 17 January , they went on hunger-strike . They were said to have been forcibly dressed in the prison uniform and held for at least 17 days with their arms chained to the cell bars to prevent them from removing the uniform . Orlando Azcu� was also said to have been beaten by prison guards on at least three occasions . In early February he was transferred to Pinar del R�o Provincial Prison after agreeing to give up his protest and end his hunger-strike . However , he again refused to wear his uniform and was forcibly dressed and handcuffed to the cell bars . On 6 March he was transferred to the prison infirmary suffering from skin problems and a dramatic fall in his blood sugar level resulting from the earlier hunger-strike . As of mid-April , he remained in the infirmary . Please send appeals requesting his immediate and unconditional release to : YUGOSLAVIA Nijazi Beqa : an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo , aged 29 , he is serving a four-year prison sentence in Dubrav prison near Istok . Nijazi Beqa , a student of physics , married with one child , was one of 10 ethnic Albanians from the area of Urosevac in Kosovo arrested in September 1988 . They were charged with having formed a " hostile " organization aimed at securing republic status for Kosovo province . Kosovo , a province of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia , borders on Albania and most of its population are ethnic Albanians . Nijazi Beqa and his co-defendants were accused of having joined an illegal organization , of having distributed " hostile propaganda materials " and of organizing petitions of a " hostile " nature to officials in and outside Yugoslavia . At their trial in Pristina in February 1989 , all were found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment . The Yugoslav federal criminal law was changed in 1990 and many people convicted for similar non-violent political activity were released . It is reported that on 22 March Nijazi Beqa and five other political prisoners there went on a hungers-strike against their conditions . Please write appealing for the immediate and unconditional release of Nijazi Beqa to : CAMEROON Olivier Nwaha Binya'a : a Jehovah 's Witness , he has been detained without charge or trial since May 2984 because of his religious beliefs . Olivier Nwaha Binya'a appears to be held in indefinite administrative detention without any opportunity to challenge his imprisonment . A 1970 presidential decree banning the movement was apparently prompted by the mass abstention by Jehovah 's Witnesses from voting in a presidential election . Since 1970 hundreds of Jehovah 's Witnesses have been detained without charge or trial for up to five years . In 1983 AI learned of the release of a group of Jehovah 's Witnesses who had been held without trial since 1978 . In December 1984 at least 80 Jehovah 's Witnesses were arrested in Limb� , southwest Cameroon , after holding an unauthorized religious meeting . which is used mainly f or political prisoners and others held in administrative detention . His health has deteriorated ; the prison diet is poor and medical treatment inadequate . Please send courteous letters appealing for his immediate release to : RELEASED ! TEAM WORK FINDING THE FACTS HOW DOES AMNESTY SET ABOUT ESTABLISHING WHETHER A PRISONER IS INDEED A PRISONER OF CONSCIENCE ? WHAT ARE OUR SOURCES OF INFORMATION ? BY MICHAEL CROWLEY Governments , as a rule , do not publicize their human rights violations . On the contrary , using the tools of censorship , intimidation , disinformation and propaganda , they surround them with walls of silence and lies . Amnesty 's job is to breach these walls , to discover the truth within , and then to act . The immense task of gathering , analysing and confirming allegations of human rights violations from around the world falls to the Research Department at the International Secretariat , Amnesty 's headquarters in London . " We are obviously not there when someone is being tortured or killed . When we hear of such cases , we investigate and draw on as many sources as possible to find out what happened ... In one sense it 's very much like good investigative journalism , " explains Malcolm Smart , Head of Research at the IS . The information comes to the IS through myriad channels , some of them formal -- over 1,100 newspapers , journals , government bulletins and transcripts of radio broadcasts are sifted -- and others that are less predictable . The plight of an Argentinian clerk , Perico Rodriguez , imprisoned and tortured because of his criticisms of the military government , was brought to Amnesty 's attention by an English couple who had previously befriended Rodriguez two years earlier when they were hitch-hiking across Argentina . Each Amnesty member participating in letter-writing actions and each local group involved in adopting or investigating a prisoner case is a researcher of potential new information : as part of their campaign to free Sudanese POC Bashir Abdelrahim , members of the Leamington and Kenilworth group wrote to the Prison Commander at Shalla Prison , where Bashir was held , in the remote Western Sudan . No reply was received but the group later heard that Bashir had been released . Time passed . Then earlier this year the group received a reply from another prisoner at Shalla who had been given their letter to Bashir by mistake . AI discovered from his letter the appalling living conditions at Shalla , including a water shortage and rampant diseases . The letter-writer is an orthopaedic surgeon who was taken off a plane as he was about to make a short visit to the UK where he had been a post-graduate student . This was in September 1989 and he has been in prison since . He enclosed a list of the 28 political prisoners still at the prison . A vital source of first hand information is generated by the many missions and research trips Amnesty sends to countries each year for on-the-spot investigations and to observe trials , meet prisoners and talk to government officials . During the first 11 months of 1990 AI sent 68 delegates to 50 countries ranging from Jordan to Nepal , from the USA to Romania . Despite the difficulties of getting into and travelling around many of these countries -- due to poor roads , curfews , civil wars , monsoons -- researchers often uncover information and testimony they would never otherwise obtain . In the Philippines last year , an investigation team found two " disappeared " women who had been missing for several months . The government had not acknowledged their arrest but the team had heard rumours of the women 's whereabouts in a military camp and in fact found them there . When Amnesty International visited Yemen in October 1990 to prepare for government talks , they heard reports of thousands of Yemenis being expelled from Saudi Arabia , some after being tortured . The delegates went to the border and spent three days there screening hundreds of people and conducting in-depth interviews with many of them . The organization urgently appealed to the Saudi king to stop the torture and brought the plight of the victims to international attention . On several occasions , however , delegates have faced obstruction and harassment in carrying out their research . An AI mission to Argentina in November 1976 , led by Lord Avebury , was followed everywhere by twenty plainclothes policemen who questioned , intimidated and even detained a number of people whom they meet . On one official visit to two refugee hostels , the delegates were accompanied by four pick-up trucks containing sixteen armed men , whose presence did little to reassure the refugees and encourage communications . In one notorious case in July 1966 , Nils Groth , a Danish lawyer on an AI mission to Guinea to enquire about prisoners of conscience became one himself . He was arrested shortly after his arrival and was detained without trial until September when he was sentenced to ten years ' hard labour for alleged espionage . He was released 22 hours after sentencing under a special amnesty declared by the President , Seku Torre . AI delegations have been expelled from countries after discovering evidence of human rights abuse and several countries , such as China , have refused Amnesty entry . However even when frontiers are closed fast to Amnesty , information still gets out -- via refugees or victims who have fled in fear , " friendly " foreigners or nationals inside the country , church , trade union and human rights organizations , journalists or travellers , or from letters smuggled across the border . Even from the jails themselves , the cries of hope , of despair , implorings not to be forgotten escape : Muriel " Rucia " Dockendorff was seized by Chilean security police soon after the bloody coup of 1973 and " disappeared " . The Chilean Government denied all responsibility for her detention . However in October 1974 this message -- addressed to a former inmate -- was smuggled out of the infamous prison , Cuatro Alamos , on the inside of a cigarette packet . Dearest Sandra , I remember when I first met you at the house of terror ; what you gave me , all that you gave me . In those moments when a light was a dream or a miracle , you were light in that darkness . We were one in adversity . Today -- a thousand trials later -- I see you as before , as I know you are today , somewhere , always looking to the future . We will meet again one day through the fog that we will clear . Do not forget me dear comrade . Rucia . Of course , all sources of information must be confirmed as credible -- sources could be using AI as a propaganda tool . " We are well aware of this danger and do n't blindly accept what people say , " states Malcolm Smart . " It comes down to applying a judgement based on the background knowledge we 've acquired from 30 years of monitoring and reporting human rights " . Amnesty knows , for example , what the long term pattern of abuse is in a country : the known torture methods , the likely victims , the agencies regularly implicated in violations . This background experience is coupled with knowledge of a country 's laws , constitution and judicial process and political and historical background . " When you 've done research on a country for years , you also get a sense of which groups have vested interests or political agendas , who can be trusted and who has given us reliable information , " said Smart . Amnesty also has its own checks which ensure that all its major reports are passed through several levels of approvals , often up to the Secretary General himself . It is also AI 's practice to give its material to governments before publication for their views and additional information and the organization will publish these in its reports . " I 'd be delighted if governments could prove all our reports wrong , if that means that human rights are n't being violated , " Smart said . " but invariably , even when we have needed to correct or update details in our reports , the sad fact remains that the overall portrait of horror has been shown to be true and if anything , understated .

US DEATH PENALTY Back Yard Blues There are over 2,300 inmates on America 's death rows : all have found themselves caught up in the nightmare that is the US capital law system . By Piers Bannister . Three years of being a member of the Campaign Team at AI had not prepared me for seeing human rights abuses first hand . President Bush 's recent pronouncements on what is just and moral during the Gulf war left me feeling empty and bitter . having been in the US 's " back yard " I know how little attention is paid to those issues there . The violence in America is frightening . Homicides reached 23,000 in 1990 , an increase of 15 per cent on the previous year . Drugs , poverty and the availability of hand guns all play their part . But rather than address these basic problems , politicians look for the quick " fix " -- anything that sounds good in a sound-bite will do . Unfortunately , increased use of the death penalty appears to be the most popular solution . The definition of capital murder -- which carries the death penalty -- varies from state to state : in Alabama , a capital murder is one that occurs during the course of a robbery , or where the victim is kidnapped or raped ; or , where the perpetrator is on parole or has escaped from custody ; or where the crime is particularly cruel . In practice , however , issues such as the colour and social standing of the victim will also play a major part . Since 1973 , in Columbus , Georgia , a death sentence has been sought for 43.8 per cent of those accused of killing a white female and only 2.6 per cent of those accused of killing a black female . Also , if the DA is coming to the end of his/ her four-year term , seeking the death penalty may improve their chances of re-election . Once accused of capital murder , the defendant will almost certainly have a problem finding an attorney . Capital law is much more complicated -- but far less lucrative -- than " ordinary " criminal law , so attorneys not specialise in defence work and are reluctant to take cases . Also , attorneys may be putting themselves up for huge amounts of emotional strain , knowing that their clients stand to lose more than their liberty . Since almost all those on death row come from impoverished backgrounds they lack the funds to hire their own attorney and will be appointed counsel by the Court . There are numerous examples of the poor quality of court-appointed lawyers ; John Young went to his death even though his trial lawyer had signed an affidavit admitting he had been ill-prepared at trial due to drug use , the recent break-up of his marriage and the discovery of his own homosexuality ; another attorney had his breath checked by the judge for signs of alcohol , another was found to be in contempt of court after arriving back from lunch drunk ... and so I could go on . When the case comes to trial the inexperienced attorney ( a good lawyer may have managed to get the charge reduced to straight murder ) will be faced by a prosecutor who may well specialize in capital law . The first part of proceeding will be the jury selection , known as the vior dire . The jury will be " death qualified " ( in the case of Alabama capital law ) : all jurors have to believe in capital punishment , and be prepared to sentence someone to death . Since black people in the southern states have suffered more injustices at the hands of the law they tend to be less likely to hand out death sentences . Therefore the prosecution will strike blacks from the jury . Although this is technically against the rules , it is still common practice . If challenged to justify why blacks are struck from the jury , prosecutors offer the most ridiculous reasons -- " he looked dumb " , " he lived in the same part of town as the defendant " ( most blacks live in the same part of town ) , " he was a mason and I was worried about masonic links " ( the prospective juror was a stone mason by profession ) . Amazingly enough , all these reasons were found acceptable by the judge . Open racism in court may continue throughout the trial : one defendant was defended by an attorney who regularly used the term " nigger " to describe his client and , it later transpired , was the local Grand Wizard for the Ku Klux Klan . If you are found guilty , the trial enters into its next very complicated part -- the sentencing phase . A good defence lawyer would now be armed with all the mitigating circumstances of your life : mental records , character witnesses , ... any reason why your life should be spared . In reality , most attorneys have made almost no preparation for this phase and do not really understand it . Jurors in the case of Dalton Prejean were unaware of his long-term mental problems when sentencing him to death . At least one member of the jury said he would not have given a sentence of death ( which must be unanimous ) had he known that Prejean had suffered prolonged mental and physical abuse from his guardians . Once sentenced to death the nightmare gets worse : very little care is taken with the inmate 's emotions . When Roger Collins was sentenced to death aged 18 he had no idea what would happen next . He recalls , " When I was sentenced I thought I 'd be killed straight away . Even when I went to prison it was n't explained to me . I sat in my cell expecting to be called out for execution at any moment . I remember feeling really happy when I was told I had at least six or seven years to live . That makes me angry now . " Conditions on most death rows are appalling . In Alabama 's West Jefferson Prison inmates are kept in tiny cells , with the bare minimum of furniture . There is no outside view of any sort and the only time they leave the cell is for weekend visits from relatives , bi-daily showers or for 45 minutes ' daily exercise . It is not surprising that many inmates want to give up their appeals . The hardest two hours of my life were spent trying to persuade David Nelson to take up his appeals . David had decided to seed " voluntary " execution -- to drop all appeals and allow his execution to take place . His attorney had managed to get him to take them up again and I went to the prison to have the necessary papers signed . During the interim period the prison authorities had taken David 's favourite visitor off his visiting list causing him to drift into despair . After two hours Ii managed to get David to sign the papers knowing full well that , after over 12 years of living in those conditions , I would probably want to die myself . Those awaiting execution will spend their last days almost entirely alone . They will be moved to the " death house " into a room that is often adjacent to the electric chair where they may hear the chair being tested at regular intervals . Some states even go to the trouble of having two switches , one a " dummy " , so that everyone can say , " it was n't me who actually killed him " . It is a separate tragedy altogether that , in a country where there is no nation health service , anything up to three million dollars can be spent killing someone . While over 2,300 people wait on death rows countrywide to see if they will die or not , we can only hope that the US comes to its senses soon . Prisoners executed in Arizona during the 1920s .

SRI LANKA PARADISE IN TURMOIL Amnesty 's major Sri Lanka ( September-December 1990 ) succeeded , against considerable obstacles , in bringing the tragedy of Sri Lanka to the attention of the world , and helped generate some fresh signs of change . By Peter Nicholls The Government of Sri Lanka has shown itself to be increasingly sensitive to the outcry over its appalling human rights record over the last decade . However , it has yet to take concrete steps to stop atrocities , or bring their perpetrators to justice . No effort has been made to investigate the tens of thousands of murders and " disappearances " that have occurred over the past three years : in February , Sri Lankan human rights activists estimated that 40,000 people had " disappeared " since 1987 . These dreadful events took place in the south of Sri Lanka , which is dominated by the majority Sinhalese population . From 1987-1990 an uprising by the Sinhalese Janatha Vimukthi Perammuna ( JVP ) Movement was ruthlessly suppressed by the government . The repression continues today , albeit on a smaller scale . At a recent meeting in London on human rights in Sri Lanka , MP Fernando Pulle Jeyaraj gave a graphic description of the torture and detention houses in which JVP " suspects " are held by the security forces . " Disappearances " occur daily in Sinhalese parts of the island and mutilated bodies are still found dumped along road sides . Along with the thousands of appeal letters sent as a result of Amnesty 's campaign , perhaps the clearest direct pressure is being exerted by the Sri Lanka Aid Consortium , made up of donor governments and multi-lateral institutions . They have made it clear that from October 1991 aid disbursements will be conditional on improvements in the human rights record of the Sri Lankan government . This aid money -- worth US$1 billion per annum -- is crucial to the fulfilment of the government 's economic policies . There have been some events which give qualified cause for optimism . Perhaps most important is the development of a " Mothers " Front " to campaign for investigations into the mass " disappearances " . Modelled on similar organizations in Argentina and Central America , it consists mainly of mothers whose husbands , sons and daughters have " disappeared " or are known to have been murdered by the government or the JVP . Although headed by opposition MPs , it has grown independently on a national basis and held its first large scale rally in Colombo in late February 1991 . Based in the Sinhalese south of the island , the Mothers ' Front has nonetheless stated its intention to embrace those affected by the thousands of " disappearances " in the Tamil-dominated areas of the north and east of the country . One of the inspirations behind the Front is Dr Manorani Saravanamuttu whose son , the well-known journalist and broadcaster Richard de Zoysa , was abducted and murdered in a February 1990 . Dr Manorani spoke at a number of Amnesty meetings last autumn . The Sri Lankan government has moved to try to counter the criticisms of its human rights record . In November , a Presidential Task Force on human rights was set up , consisting of senior figures close to President Premadasa . Its main function , however , appears to be to present a better image of Sri Lanka to the outside world . More promising was the inauguration in January 1991 of a Commission of Enquiry into new cases of " disappearance " . This Commission consists of five senior members of the judiciary and legal profession . Its 12-month brief is to investigate all new reports of " disappearance " . While falling way short of Amnesty International 's request for investigations into all " disappearances " , this initiative is welcomed as a modest first step in the right direction . The government has at last acknowledged that " disappearances " do take place and that it is a problem which needs addressing , and Amnesty International expects to be submitting cases for investigation by the Commission . Two AI delegates attended a conference in Colombo from 11 to 16 March on trades union and human rights in South Asia as guest speakers . While there , they also met government officials and discussed possibilities for future access by AI to Sri Lanka . Amnesty was last permitted access to the country in 1982 . The government subsequently announced that " a research visit to Sri Lanka would be considered favourably if a formal request were made " . This pattern of greater flexibility toward outside investigation of human rights abuses is also shown by the Sri Lankan government 's acceptance of visits by both the UN Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial Executions and the UN Working Group on Disappearances . These are now due to occur in 1991 , having been postponed on several occasions over the past few years . Such developments , along with the continuing work of the International Committee of the Red Cross within the country , are welcome in themselves and also give some evidence that the Sri Lankan Government is responsive to criticism from outside the country . Unfortunately , even these modest advances apply only to the south of Sri Lanka , the primary focus of Amnesty 's campaign last autumn . While the situation in the south remains a major concern , greater violations of human rights are now occurring in the North and Eastern provinces of the island , where government security forces are engaged in a full-scale civil war with elements of the Tamil-minority population . The main opposition group in this region is the armed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) whose political aim is a separate Tamil homeland ( Eeelam ) in North-East Sri Lanka . The conflict has continued , with varying degrees of intensity , for over 10 years . Predictably , the main sufferers since fighting flared once more in June 1990 have been the civilian populations -- Tamil , Sinhalese and Moslem . The population in the north and east are now living in terrible conditions . With hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes by the conflict , the economy of these areas has been devastated and government forces are laying siege to many parts of the north , often involving inaccurate and indiscriminate bombardments of civilian population centres . The LTTE has also been responsible for massacres , both of Sinhalese and Moslem civilians , since June 1990 and against rival Tamil political groups who , in some cases , have now aligned themselves with the government 's forces . Repression by the Sri Lankan security forces in the eastern province has been savage and widespread . The rule of law in Sri Lanka has been seriously eroded : in the past three years , over a dozen lawyers have been murdered because of their involvement with human rights cases and at least 20 others have been forced to flee the country after receiving death threats . Only concerted action and investigation by the government can right these tragic injustices that continue to occur .

MOROCCO SPEAKING IN SHADOWS I had seen her face before , but only in silhouette , anonymous , as she spoke out about the inhuman conditions of political prisoners in Morocco 's forgotten dungeons . By Dan Jones We met on a wild , windy day near the Ferry in a port on the South Coast . She is a small , passionate , very striking young woman with deep shining black eyes and a glittering smile , talking ten to the dozen in a strong Moroccan accent . She told me that she was eight years old , the eldest of six children , when the security men came to the army camp to arrest her father , an officer in the Moroccan army , in 1972 . He was accused of involvement in one of two failed military coups in Morocco which had attempted to overthrow King Hassan II . Her mother was only about 21 at the time -- she had been married when only 13 . The family were then living in the military camp at Harmoumou . A number of the officers arrested were executed almost immediately . Her father was sentenced to death . The young woman remembers how her mother would leave home at 5am day after day , and wait in the Marmoura forest near where the King used to play golf in an effort to plead with him for her husband 's life . Despite being repeatedly arrested and brought back home , bruised and beaten by the police , she finally got to see the King by throwing herself into the road in front of the Royal car . " There is nothing I can do , " said the King , as she was dragged away , " I can see those in charge , but it 's now in the hands of the Justice people . " However , the father 's sentence was changed to one of life imprisonment . At first the men were held in Kenitra Central Prison . The family were able to visit him once or twice a week . There they would meet many other relatives of the arrested men . A close relationship developed among the visitors . One day in August 1973 , without warning , visitors were not allowed to enter the prison . They were told that the prisoners were not there any more . The relatives of the 61 men who had vanished lobbied ministers and the King 's sister and brother . It was an extremely sensitive matter , they were told . But there was absolutely no news of the men . At last , in 1975 , the wife of one of the prisoners , a former air force pilot , telephoned the young woman 's mother to come to her house quickly . The woman showed her a bundle of tiny packages , secret notes , from some of the disappeared men , smuggled out of their secret jail by one of the guards . The guard was still in the house . The young woman 's father was one of the letter-writers . His note consisted of a few words , impersonal , noncommittal , on a tiny scrap of paper written with a burned matchstick . But he was alive . In his note he asked for medical help -- some vitamins , eye-drops , " as I ca n't go out " -- and for some money . It seemed that the men pooled their money to help survive . Her mother tried to persuade the woman who had received the letters to let her talk with this guard ; a man who was actually in touch with her husband . Perhaps he could tell how he was , or where ? She could see him through the shutters -- a big man , a Berber , a kind-looking man with bright blue eyes and tattoos . But the woman said he would simply not risk meeting her -- it was too dangerous . One of the group of relatives , an old woman who walked very slowly , also had a letter . Her son was very ill . She decided to try and visit him . They had a vague idea where the place was . It was a very long journey right across the Atlas mountains and down to the edge of the desert . Long before she reached the place , the car was stopped by the military . " There is no prison here . Turn back ! Who told you there was a prison ? " They were taken away for questioning . " Who is spreading these rumours ? " they wanted to know . The old woman 's son was one of the many prisoners who have subsequently died in the prison . A year later a second note was among another smuggled group of notes that arrived for the relatives . " I received the materials that you sent . " In 1977 another letter came , then a long silence until 1981 , then a letter in 1984 . Sadly , the notes referred to money and medicines that had been sent by the family but not received in the prison . Everything exchanged in the secret correspondence has to be tiny so it can be hidden in the palm of the hand : pills , passport sized pictures of the family . The little notes are coded . There is little real information . You have to read between the lines . The smuggled letters take three days ' journey to Rabat from the prison : some never arrive . In November 1990 , a further letter arrived , saying the young woman 's father was ill : he wanted 150,000 Dirham , and his wife should give 100,000 Dirham to the guard . " Send me photographs of the children . " He wrote that he was lying on a concrete floor ; he mentioned acute rheumatism , chronic bronchitis ; " My ribs are tight , I have a lot of fever , I cough all the time . I am exhausted ... I can not sleep at night ... my heart is weak ... my feet are heavy ... I am unable even to say my prayers upright . " Twenty-nine of the prisoners have already died , Pilot Mohammed El Shamey has lost his mind , one has taken his own life . Recently , an anonymous note , clearly composed from a dialogue between a prisoner and a sympathetic guard , was smuggled out . It described where the prisoners were held : ; the people of Tazmamert appear to be hardly aware of it or too frightened to talk about it . It is said that the prison director steals the fuel to warm his own house in Meknes . The note describes the walk downstairs to visit the cells . You use a torch to see anything . This first cell is now empty , and a second , and a third . In the fourth cell there is a man with long dishevelled hair . His clothes are in rags , and do not even cover his private parts . " they are denied medical care . They sleep on the floor without mattress or bedcover . The smell is so terrible you want to throw up . The men have been locked up in their cells since day one of their imprisonment . " Clothes are changed once every three years . They are unshaven , there is no barber . The food is " maigre " ; cold coffee in the morning , with half a piece of bread , lunch a thin soup of rotten vegetables , the evening meal boiled pasta and the same stinking soup . Tazmamert has been the great forbidden subject in Morocco . The prisoners have been held incommunicado for eighteen years . The sentences of most of the military prisoners were completed years ago , but nobody is released . No journalist will risk prison to put an article in the paper . According to King Hassan II and his government , the prison does not exist -- or , even if it does , the people all love the King so much it would be unsafe to release the prisoners -- they might be killed by the populace . We finished our coffee and watched the seagulls whirling and shrieking over the harbour in the spring sunshine . In some cases of " disappearance " the whole family is held responsible for the " crime " of one of its members . One notable example involved the " disappearance " of eight members of the family of General Mohammed Oufkir . Following his death in suspicious circumstances in 1972 , his widow and six children , together with a female cousin , " disappeared " . Nothing was heard of them for fifteen years . In February 1991 , they were released , but are still subject to restrictions on freedom of movement and association . Right : A demonstration in the early 1980s by families of political prisoners . Political prisoners do not receive fair trials in Morocco . SOUTH AFRICA RIGHTING THE RECORD Confidence is the key . President de Klerk said so in London at the end of April . By Brian Dooley If de Klerk can convince the world that South Africa has come far enough in improving its record on human rights , sanctions will be lifted and crucial foreign capital will start flowing into the country . However , the State President is not as confident as he would like to be . To coincide with his latest visit to Europe , Amnesty released a document outlining the apparent lack of accountability of the security forces . Deaths in detention are not phenomena of the distant past : last year two people were reported as having died in custody . In February this year , the Minister of Law and Order declared that the government would not repeal its most notorious detention law , section 29 of the Internal Security Act , which permits indefinite , incommunicado detention in solitary confinement for the purposes of interrogation . Those who dies last year were held under this provision . Detentions under section 29 continue , and the government acknowledged on March 18 that 16 people were then held under that provision . Even more prisoners , about 60 , are currently being held under equivalent provisions in the nominally independent " homelands " of the Transkei and Bophuthatswana . Two months ago Amnesty submitted testimony to the UN which noted that the de Klerk government " was failing to take adequate steps to investigate and bring to justice members of the security forces implicated in the torture and killing of government opponents " . The death of one 16-year-old under interrogation at a police station in January 1990 has yet to be properly investigated . A closed hearing held in February this year concluded that no-one could be held responsible for the death . De Klerk dismissed suggestions that he ca n't control his security forces by pointing out that he appointed 10,000 police officers last year , and claims that the new influx will go a long way in helping subdue township unrest . However , with various groups suggesting police complicity in township violence , many blacks will find little security in a larger police force . Despite the political reforms , many members of the security forces are carrying on business as usual . In March , a judicial inquest into the death of 42 people in Sebokeng township in September 1990 concluded with the presiding judge finding members of the South African Defence Force criminally responsible for the deaths of four people and rejected claims that the concerned were provoked to shoot in self-defence . Both Sebokeng inquiries exposed a pattern of unlawful behaviour by members of the security forces and lend weight to allegations of unprovoked use of lethal force by security forces , like in Daveytown on 24 March when 12 members of the ANC were shot dead by the police . Accusations continue of security force involvement in covert assassinations . On March 27 , in Alexandra township outside Johannesburg , at least 14 people were killed when men armed with automatic weapons opened fire on mourners at a night-time vigil . The police had been asked by the organizers of the vigil to provide protection after an incident earlier in the evening when about 200 suspicious-looking men appeared outside the house where the vigil was being held . According to those at the vigil , the police only checked on the hose twice before the massacre occurred at 4am . The apparent failure of the police to act promptly and effectively , including their failure to apprehend a large group of armed men under conditions of curfew in the township creates the suspicion that police were colluding with the attackers . Despite the hype over the release of political prisoners , reports of police misconduct do not inspire confidence in the majority of South Africans , or in those all-important foreign investors . Police attack black workers in Johannesburg . REFUGEES JUMPING THE HURDLES Asylum-seekers attempting to enter the UK encounter many difficulties with our refugee-determination procedures . By Jan Shaw " Please do n't send me back . Kill me here " . This was the plea of a young Eritrean boy as he was being dragged back to the plane that had just brought him to the UK , when in September 1990 , he and his sister were denied access to the asylum procedure . He was afraid of being sent back to Ethiopia , where close family members had been imprisoned and tortured . Prior to this incident , in April 1990 three Sri Lankan Tamils attempted to seek asylum in the UK . Before their arrival at Heathrow , their passports and tickets were confiscated ; when the British Airways plane landed , they were separated from the other passengers , put into a van and driven around for several hours before being forced back on the plane and sent out of the UK . Unfortunately these are not isolated incidents . Other cases are known to Amnesty International , where asylum seekers travelling without valid travel documents have been prevented by airline personnel , sometimes with the knowledge of Immigration Officers , from applying for political asylum in this country . Also in April 1990 , six Sri Lankan Tamils were prevented by Egyptair staff from disembarking at Heathrow : in August 1990 , four Eritreans were prevented from leaving a Czechoslovak Airlines plane . There can be little doubt that such examples represent the tip of an iceberg . What has forced airline staff to take on this policing role of checking the travel documents of would-be asylum seekers ? In 1987 the British Government introduced legislation which imposes fines on airlines bringing passengers to the UK without valid documents . The Immigration ( Carriers ' Liability ) Act provides for a fine of �1,000 per passenger lacking such documentation . It is thought that the Government may soon double this fine . Since its implementation , fines totalling more than �24 million have been imposed under the Act and clearly some airlines have adopted practices aimed at minimizing the number of penalties incurred . The fining of airlines plus the fact that the nationals of many refugee-producing countries now need visas to travel to this country , has made it extremely difficult for many people wishing to apply for asylum , to reach the UK . When people are fleeing from fear of imprisonment , torture or death , they will use any means available to reach a safe country . For many people attempting to escape from state persecution , it is impossible to apply for a passport to the very authorities who are inflicting the persecution . The need to obtain an entry visa from an embassy often situated far away could be dangerous and could therefore hinder departure . Instead of introducing procedures which can be relied upon to identify and protect all those at risk of human rights violations in their own country , Government has introduced a range of measures which create obstacles in the path of those seeking asylum in the UK . In particular in recent years , the Government 's response to large numbers of people fleeing from state oppression is to impose visas on nationals of that country . During the period of 1984-5 , more than 2,800 Sri Lankans sought asylum in the UK and in May 1985 , a visa requirement was imposed on the nationals of Sri Lanka , the first time such a requirement was imposed on the nationals of a Commonwealth country . Subsequently in June 1989 a visa requirement was imposed on Turkish nationals after more than 3,500 Turkish Kurds had sought asylum at UK ports . In 1989 more than 2,600 Somalis sought asylum in the UK ; from August 1990 , Somali nationals could no longer transit the UK without visas . In April 1991 a visa requirement was imposed on nationals of Uganda ; from January to September 1990 , some 1,960 Ugandan nationals sought asylum in the UK . As there is no provision in the UK immigration rules for issuing visas to asylum seekers overseas , in an embassy or High Commission , there is a contradiction in the requirement of visas for asylum seekers to enter the country . It is to be regretted that many of the Government 's measures relating to its asylum policy introduced in the past few years , have been to discourage new arrivals . Amnesty International has asked the Government on many occasions to lift those measures which place obstacles in the path of asylum seekers attempting to gain access to the refugee-determination process . In November 1990 , the Government conceded that the Immigration ( Carriers Liability ) Act and associated visa requirements " do indeed prevent some asylum seekers from coming to the UK " , but further stated that it " has no obligation to encourage or assist would-be asylum seekers ... to come here and enter our procedures " . We hope that in line with our recommendations , the Government will amend its procedures which obstruct the access to the refugee-determination process of those escaping from violations of their basic human rights . Tamil protest at Heathrow in 1987 GROUP NEWS 30 YEARS OF LOCAL GROUPS ! TODAY THERE ARE 4,200 LOCAL AMNESTY GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD . 315 OF THESE ARE IN THE UK , WORKING ON BEHALF OF 318 INDIVIDUALS AND RAISING MORE THAN �260,000 A YEAR TO FURTHER AMNESTY 'S WORK . How did it all begin ? Peter Benenson , in his original article in the Observer in 1961 , envisaged a central " library " , providing information on prisoners of conscience " to any group , existing or new , in any part of the world , which decides to join in a special effort in favour of freedom of opinion or religion . " The response to this call was and has continued to be overwhelming . Perhaps this is because , as a member of the Abingdon Group put it : " In a group there is the fun and companionship ... and the awe at saving a life , supporting a prisoner through years of isolation , getting your prisoner free . " The first local Amnesty groups ( the still-running Eltham and Hampstead among them ) were formed only months after the launch in May 1961 . From then on the number grew impressively fast . By the end of 1961 there were 11 groups , nine in the UK , one in Norway and one in Australia . In February 1963 there were already 180 groups worldwide . The increase was even felt to be too great : in 1964 , when British groups reached 212 , it was decided to slow down the growth in the UK -- not to " act upon the ephemeral enthusiasms of an odd individual " , but to go for quality . There was also concern that groups were growing faster in the UK than in the rest of the world . The number of UK groups reached 300 in the early 1980s and has remained around that level ever since -- groups of very high quality and certainly not based on " ephemeral enthusiasms " ! These early groups were called " Threes Groups " because each adopted three prisoners , one from the East , one from the West and one from Afro-Asian countries . In many cases a group would divide into sub-groups and work on more than three at a time . At one point Manchester University group was working on 39 ! It came as something of a shock in the late 1970s , when developments in the human rights situation around the world and the increase in groups worldwide and the increase in groups worldwide led to fewer prisoner cases being available for UK groups . This did not mean , unfortunately , that human rights were being respected , but that regimes around the world were using new methods of repression such as " disappearances " and extrajudicial executions . Amnesty groups ' work responded to the challenge with new techniques such as networks focusing on abuses in specific areas of the world and campaigns on whole countries or themes . For example , a " Murder by Governments Campaign " in October 1983 resulted in funeral marches with black " coffins " , drumbeats , and candles in Diss , Norwich , Bognor Regis , and London . How to find the money necessary to carry out Amnesty 's work has always been a worry , and from the very beginning the Section Office asked groups for help in this area . However , in the first few years groups did not appear to consider fundraising a priority . A newsletter in 1964 complains that " it is clear that the requested �10 per annum is more than one group can manage . " It is extraordinary to consider that nowadays groups manage a contribution of �600 per annum ! The next year , 19675 , however , fundraising was already improving -- Kensington Group arranged a film show at the Kensington Public Library and raised �81.15.0d . There are some aspects of group work which never change -- the satisfaction felt on receiving a letter such as this , for example : " ... suddenly I became free by some secret action , and now I am so happy I found your letter concerning my person . I am thankful and happy that there was a strange and foreign soul caring about the destiny of a political prisoner in East Germany ... when we passed the border last night , I just cried . " ( From a student released from an East Berlin jail in 1964 ) Anniversaries have also been celebrated before . In 1971 groups were busy thinking up ways to mark Amnesty 's 10th birthday . The Bristol group collected the signatures of 46 international figures to sell for Amnesty funds . They tried 60 well-known personalities . Harold Wilson was the first to reply -- by return post . Groups were still being run by a very small section office . A 10th Anniversary article in the Observer referred to it as " a small back-room in an alley off London 's Fleet Street , " and within days the office was getting letters addressed to " Amnesty , Alley Off Fleet Street " . On 28 May 1986 , Amnesty 's 25th Anniversary , St Clement Danes Church in the Strand , London , rang 5,000 chimes , roughly one for every POC case Amnesty had worked on during the year . Groups went in for all kinds of sponsored walks , knit-ins , beard-shavings , and even silence . The 25th Anniversary campaign had dramatic results : individual membership increased from 25,000 at the end of 1985 to 35,000 at the end of 1986 : a full 30 per cent increase in one year . This year 's 30th Anniversary could be our chance to make the 90s the decade in which groups shoot ahead . Help us achieve this : join your local group !

LETTERS DISTURBING MEASURES I have just received David Bull 's appeal for funds , with the short version of Amnesty 's report on Human Rights Violations in Iraqi Occupied Kuwait ( since August 1990 ) enclosed . I am afraid that by taking the extraordinary measure of stapling this report " because some of the contents are so disturbing " , Amnesty has again given credence to the belief that recent torture in Kuwait has been more terrible than in any other part of the world , whereas the repugnant patterns of pain-infliction described are all too familiar from Iran , from Myanmar , Amin 's Uganda , a South America , South Africa etc . Although we may claim that we simply publish an objective report , the inference that exceptional evil existed during the occupation of Kuwait will naturally be made by those trying to justify the devastating Allied bombardment of Iraq , now retrospectively . I feel Amnesty has to provide a quiet , more balanced overview of a region in order to maintain its impartiality and credibility , and to operate effectively . ANGELA MACTAVISH , Bognor Regis OFFICIAL PRAYERS ? Participating as a group delegate and individual member in the vigorous AGM at Liverpool , I was surprised to see a religious service on the printed agenda , with the order of service available at the official information counter . As a private activity there could be no objection to Christian members calling their fellow-believers to prayer , and I suppose that I and fellow-members of the British Humanist Association could have similarly organized a non-official meeting . But the universal character of Amnesty should surely bar the incorporation of any religious observance into its official procedures . ARTHUR JACOBS , Sevenoaks GREAT INSIGHT ... I was delighted to see you had chosen a young man and woman with Down 's Syndrome to model shirts in the Spring 1991 catalogue . I have worked for 14 years as a care assistant in a special school , and although the general attitude towards individuals with a mental handicap is gradually changing , it is both reassuring and encouraging to see youngsters such as these becoming a more regular part of " everyday life " . I applaud your decision to employ them , and shall leave your catalogue in the staffroom tomorrow . Congratulations on your insight . JEAN MARTIN , Manchester . ... IS WELCOME As parents of a four-month-old daughter with Down 's Syndrome we have only recently become very aware of how handicapped children and adults are kept to the sidelines ... your catalogue makes a very welcome change . JULIA MARKUS AND PAUL JORDAN , Shaftesbury . DURING PRISONER OF CONSCIENCE WEEK 1990 , SECOND YEAR PUPILS OF PEEBLES HIGH SCHOOL HEARD ABOUT AMNESTY 'S LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGN FROM THEIR LOCAL AMNESTY GROUP . THE PUPILS GOT THE MESSAGE , AND GOT WRITING . HERE ARE TWO RESULTING LETTERS ... Your Excellency , I am writing to you about the case of Im Su-Kyong , who was arrested for ten years for attending a peace march from North Korea to South Korea . The thing is , she was arrested for ten years for going to North Korea without government permission . I feel that this sentence is far too harsh . For a woman , Kim Hyun-hui , was arrested and was to receive the death sentence for planting a bomb on a Korean Boeing 707 , killing all 115 people . Yet she was pardoned , because she was an internationally famous actress . Can you see the point I am trying to make ? I hope so . I am thirteen years old , and if ten years of my youth were taken over by four plain walls and nothing to do , I know how I would feel . Try and think how you would feel if that happened to you . Please , I am begging you , let her free . Yours respectfully and sincerely , ALISON HENDERSON . Your Excellency , I am writing as I 'm puzzled as to why you have released Kim Hyun-hui who planted a bomb on a plane and killed 115 people but have imprisoned a girl for taking part in a peace march . To me this is odd as if I were the president of South Korea I would have imprisoned Kim Hyun-hui and released Im Su Kyong as to me Kim Hyun-hui committed the more serious crime . I would like this to be explained to me as I just do n't understand it . Yours respectfully and sincerely , CHRISTOPHER SETH . <text id="bnc:5">NEEDLES IN HAY : IS IT ART CRITICISM ? TWO QUESTIONS What is art ? Leo Tolstoy asked the question , and in 1898 his remarkable book with that title gave his reply . He underlined the need for art to communicate what the artist has felt : Art is a human activity consisting in this , that one man consciously by means of certain external signs , hands on to others feelings he has lived through , and that others are infected by these feelings and also experience them . Art is not , as the metaphysicians say , the manifestation of some Idea of beauty or God ; it is not , as the aesthetic physiologists say , a game in which man lets off his excess of stored-up energy ; it is not the expression of man 's emotions by external signs ; it is not the production of pleasing objects ; and , above all , it is not pleasure but it is a means of union among men joining them together in the same feelings , and indispensable for the life and progress towards wellbeing of individuals and humanity . There are many more definitions of art besides Tolstoy 's own and those which he denounced . For the purposes of this book , just two assertions will have to content us : first , some works have been intended by their makers to be seen as art ; second , there is a consensus today that other works are to be described as art . Since art critics have these working assumptions in mind , and it is with their writing we shall be mainly concerned , we need to proceed without being distracted . We shall not look into the myriad issues springing from problems of definition which are vital for philosophers and aestheticians . Is it criticism ? There is a massive amount of writing about art , only some of which can immediately be identified by a reader as criticism . Writing by the art critic of a newspaper is self-evidently criticism , in parallel with the writing of music and theatre critics ; an exhibition can be treated almost in the same way as a performance . Articles in magazines are less certainly described as criticism , for their main topics may be personalities or history , and art may be only a small part of the writers ' account . Books and catalogues may contain criticism ; but their writers may think of themselves as art historians , philosophers , aestheticians , anthropologists , historians or biographers , and there are many other possibilities ; their books may never be identified as art criticism . As the following chapters will show , the useful and helpful functions of art criticism will receive preference in the choice of what is quoted or discussed . Is the text or part of the text written so that a reader will benefit in a future encounter with a work of art ? Some writing which is called art criticism will be helpful , some will not ; other writing will also be valuable , although whether it can be described as art criticism may be disputable . A REVEALING INSTANCE A famous passage of art criticism can be cited as one example entirely beyond dispute . The author spent much of his life as a bachelor Fellow of Brasenose College Oxford ; his cloistered life was devoted to writing , notably on classical antiquity and the Italian Renaissance . Walter Pater was a master of atmosphere ; he had been inspired as a young man by Ruskin , and his idealism about art and his fine prose were in turn much admired by a younger generation of aesthetes , among whom Oscar Wilde was a prominent figure . One of Pater 's subjects for a perceptive essay was Leonardo da Vinci ; it gave special prominence to the painting now generally known as the Mona Lisa . The following critical passage comes from this piece , first published in the Fortnightly Review in 1869 , and then in 1873 in Pater 's book , Studies in the History of the Renaissance . La Gioconda is , in the truest sense , Leonardo 's masterpiece , the revealing instance of his mode of thought and work . In suggestiveness , only the Melancholia of D�rer is comparable to it ; and no crude symbolism disturbs the effect of its subdued and graceful mystery . We all know the face and hands of the figure , set in its marble chair , in that circle of fantastic rocks , as in some faint light under sea . Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least . Pater 's measured prose goes on to connect the picture with drawings by Verrocchio , speculate on the artist and the sitter , and wonder about how long the picture was in progress . Then comes the peroration . The presence that rose thus so strangely beside the waters , is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire . Hers is the head upon which all " ends of the world are come " , and the eyelids are a little weary . It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh , the deposit , little cell by cell , of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions . Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses of beautiful women of antiquity , and how would they be troubled by this beauty , into which the soul with all its maladies has passed ! All the thoughts and experience of the world had etched and moulded there , in that which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward form , the animalism of Greece , the lust of Rome , the mysticism of the Middle Ages with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves , the return of the Pagan world , the sins of the Borgias . She is older than the rocks among which she sits ; like the vampire , she has been dead many times , and learned the secrets of the grave ; and has been a diver in deep seas , and keeps their fallen day about her ; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants ; and , as Leda , was the mother of Helen of Troy , and , as Saint Anne , the mother of Mary ; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes , and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments , and tinged the eyelids and the hands . The fancy of a perpetual life , sweeping together ten thousand experiences , is an old one ; and modern philosophy has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by , and summing up in itself , all modes of thought and life . Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy , the symbol of the modern idea . Pater 's book is a classic , and easy to find in a library . But if the books are arranged by subject , there is no certainty that The Renaissance will be put under " art criticism " . Several other headings are equally possible , say aesthetics , English literature or Italian history . The library user who looks for books of art criticism is not necessarily going to have an easy task . Let us picture a girl entering through the impressive doors of the New York Public Library . Her interest has been aroused by some new paintings which she has seen in a SoHo gallery , which a friend has compared unfavourably with the work of Lee Krasner . This comparison has fazed her , as she only knows about Lee Krasner as the widow of Jackson Pollock ; so the library visit is intended to check out reproductions of Lee Krasner 's work , to see if she has to concede that her friend may be right . The resources available to her are excellent ; the library has an extensive stock of books , long runs of periodicals , press cuttings , and up-to-date facilities to find relevant material . Among the sources she will find are critical reviews , articles , catalogues and books about New York painting of the 1940s and 1950s , which will remind her that Pollock died in 1956 . There is no shortage of writing about Pollock ; like other star artists , he has an embarrassingly large number of apologists , but fortunately there are select bibliographies which can guide her to key publications . There may , however , be questions in her mind about the choices open to her : how will the information in a catalogue differ from what is to be found in a monograph ? How much of the books about Pollock will be biography and how much will be about his art ? Among the magazine articles , which are most likely to be interesting to her ? Will she find good reproductions of Lee Krasner 's work ? Our American friend 's cousin in London is an art student . Her college library has interesting books , as well as the latest art magazines . Her course teacher has given her a reading list , and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests . As part of the course , she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ; one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views , not just copy already received opinions . She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ; it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic , since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome , and although there were plenty of books about it , many of them went into extravagant detail . Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo , and has a route map prepared , including introductory and background books , but also passages from longer scholarly works . If the two girls compare notes one day , the New Yorker will complain about the useless articles she read ; the newspaper articles were almost always short , written maybe by hard-pressed critics who were only allowed short articles , further cut down by sub-editors . Still , by reading , and looking at Lee Krasner 's pictures in New York galleries , she was able to defend an independent liking for her SoHo artist . In London , it was a rather different story , since the literature available needed discrimination , much of it being historical and iconographic , establishing data of little interest to the art student . To her surprise , there proved to be perceptive judgements about qualities in Michelangelo 's work , almost hidden in catalogue entries ; more than one art historian , apparently , was not only learned but had an eye . ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY Do art historians write about the past , while art critics write about the present ? Things are not so simple , as some art historians write well about the present , with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture . They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms , partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms . Meyer Schapiro , who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art , was an open-minded historian of this sort . He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky : " Gorky 's atmosphere , veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evokes a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable image-space of the day-dreaming mind . " And he remembered the painter : I used to meet him most often in the museums and galleries fixed in rapt contemplation of pictures with that grave , searching look which was one of the beauties of his face . As some poets are great readers , Gorky -- exceptional among painters -- was a fervent scrutinizer of paintings . No interesting touch or invention of form escaped his eye . He was equally at home in the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art , keen in discerning what was good in the arts of many ages and styles . As for working art critics , their newspapers need reviews of every sort of exhibition , whether modern or historical . Even though critics may not be as learned as their art-historical colleagues , there is no good reason for their practised eyes to cloud over when looking at art of other periods . Furthermore , artists who are also critics are especially likely to make vivid comments on the methods and techniques of old art . The guards on the frontiers between art history and art criticism shoot neither intruders nor escapers . Indeed , there are some who feel that there should be no border , thinking back nostalgically to days when there was only one domain of art . In some writing today , too , it is possible to find the words critic and historian being used interchangeably . Art is after all the subject of attention for both critic and historian , even though the functions and methods of the two sorts of writer have drawn apart . Fifty years ago they were in closer touch . It was in 1936 that the first American edition of Lionello Venturi 's History of Art Criticism was published , containing material which could equally have found a place in a book about art history . Venturi was a university teacher , son of a famous father , Adolpho Venturi , who had made a substantial contribution to the publication of documents of Italian art . Venturi 's survey started with classical times , the uncertainties of writing by Xenocrates , lists of lost works such as the treatise by Apelles , and settled down to comment on two fundamental categories of criticism , the lives of artists , and the critic 's encounter with the work of art . For the latter he quoted a sentence by Lucian , the second-century Greek rhetorician : " A work of art requires an intelligent spectator who must go beyond the pleasure of the eyes to express a judgement and to argue the reasons for what he sees . " For Venturi , an important development in art criticism came in the eighteenth century which saw the foundation of aesthetics and the rise of philosophies for which art was an indispensable ingredient . Writing as he was in the 1930s , he expressed his pleasure at the extensive documentation and reference material available to the student of art , instancing the growth of libraries and art historical teaching . If he were alive today , he would have even more cause for satisfaction . Some of the main efforts of historians in the first decades of the twentieth century had been directed to putting order into a mass of material , analysing works and documents , and establishing historical data . German art historians had begun much more systematically on this task than others . Several art historians wrote syntheses of art historical information , which became standard works . Histories of art appeared in sequences of volumes by different authors , there were several series of books about artists and on museum collections , besides which the most comprehensive biographical dictionary of artists by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker started its long publication process in 1907 . Roger Fry acknowledged German scholarship as a precursor of serious art historical studies in this century . Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art , but also he defended Post-Impressionism ( a term he invented ) , was a painter , and published a monograph on C�zanne . In 1933 he wrote as follows in a lecture at Cambridge University : An enormous amount of work has been done and perhaps still more remains to be done in arranging works of art in exact sequence of time . It is here that the Germans have done so much pioneer work , and indeed the whole tendency of their art historical studies has been to regard works of art almost entirely from a chronological point of view , as coefficients of a time sequence , without reference to their aesthetic significance . The title of the lecture in which these words appeared was Art-history as an Academic Study , but those were early days for the subject in the British Isles ; only in London was there undergraduate teaching , at the Courtauld Institute which opened in 1933 . His unusual topic gave Fry trouble with the title of his lecture : " The mere fact that we have no word to designate that body of studies which the Germans call Kunstforschung -- a body of studies of which the actual history of Art is only a part -- is significant . I am obliged to use the awkward and inadequate word " Art-history " for it . Critical appreciation was desired by fry as a necessary part of a course in art history ; , and is today naturally included . An English handbook written in 1980 even went so far as to state : " The enjoyment of looking ( what we call the aesthetic experience ) is , in fact , the core of the discipline known as Art History . " Later in the 1980s an American handbook took a more comprehensive view : The goal of art history is first to place the work of art in history and then assess it in the light of its unique position . Modern art historians strive to analyze , interpret , and evaluate works of art by identifying their materials and techniques , makers , time and place of creation , and meaning or function . They inquire about the who , what , when , where , and why of the art object ; often the object itself suggests which of these questions should be pursued . But the function of art history today is not only to make such identifications , but also to relate an individual work humanistically to other works of the same school , period and culture , while remaining sensitive to its salient aesthetic qualities . According to this American guide , " Art criticism is a many-levelled activity that comprises the historical , the recreative , and the judicial . In all cases it seeks to pronounce value judgements , an exercise shunned by art history . " The signs are that the next few years will see some extensive soul-searching about art history ; several books have already appeared . From Germany there is The End of the History of Art ; from Britain a group of essays describe The New Art History ; from the United States has recently come Rethinking Art History : meditations on a coy science ; and from Canada there is a forthright title Art History : its use and abuse . Art criticism seems more likely to remain in the shadows , out of the spotlight of academic controversy . WRITINGS ON ART Apart from art criticism and art history , there exist several other types of writing about art . There is the theory of art , and there is aesthetics ; there is writing about artefacts which may or may not be categorised as art , but are in the hands of the archaeologist or the anthropologist ; and there is art appreciation . A guide to art reference books published in 1969 had 2,500 entries , some of which referred to series ; for example , there was a single entry for the series of monographs on individual artists , called Klassiker der Kunst , also published in French as Classiques d'Art , in which there are thirty-eight books . This guide was extensively revised over nine years , and was republished in 1980 as a Guide to the Literature of Art History , intended for " persons doing serious research in the field of art history " . Another sort of writing about art is what artists themselves have written , either about their own work or about other artists . This may be by way of theory , or on more matter-of-fact lines about technique or such questions as composition . Some writing by artists takes the form of instruction ; in every period manuals on how to do it , whether drawing , making sculpture or other technical tasks are found , though their incidence is irregular , and such treatises are often the work of minor artists , rather than the great ; Leonardo is an exception . Teachers of art are more likely to write books of instruction , and in their efforts to educate their students may make comments about the traditions they admire and from which they hope their students will learn . One lesson for practical students is to analyse works . A teacher 's list for analysing pictures may be something like that of the American educationalist Thomas Munro : first impressions of the picture as a whole , line , light and dark , colour , mass , space , unity of design . Books on art appreciation will also concern themselves with formal questions , as they have done since the beginning of the century . In a book called How to Appreciate Pictures by R. C. Witt , written in 1902 , the chapter headings are not so different : drawing , colour , light and shade , composition , treatment , methods and materials . A supplementary approach to school art instruction is to draw attention to the types of subject in art , such as portraiture , narrative , landscape . This thematic method is combined in many introductory courses with formal analysis which is closer to the way that many artists describe pictures . An example of an artist acting directly as a critic is Bridget Riley , who selected a show of pictures from the collection at the National Gallery in London , in a series called " The Artist 's Eye " . Bridget Riley came to prominence as an artist in the 1960s , when her dazzling patterned paintings were a clear success in British Op Art . Her National Gallery choices of pictures were examples of problems posed to artists by colour , and in a video talk she demonstrated how these artistic problems had been solved . Connections with her own practice as a painter were evident , even though her abstract compositions were very different in subject from the works of her chosen artists , who included Veronese and Poussin . Her argument was that the subjects of the old master paintings could be disregarded by a painter who wished to find lessons for the present in the artistic practice of the past . Bridget Riley had no intention of either presenting an account of Poussin 's aims and procedures , or of demonstrating Veronese 's debts to his predecessors in Venetian art , as a historian would have felt a duty to do . The artist as critic in this case deliberately avoided the historical context of the pictures she was discussing . Any art critic may take such a position , but a historian almost never . Even if historians are specifically interested in form , it is likely to be the history of forms , or the development of styles which will have attracted their attention . It would be too crude a generalisation , though , to say that critics are concerned with form , while historians are interested in the context of art ; both the forms and contexts of art are common ground for the critic and the historian . The ground has been thoroughly explored over the last 250 years , which is one estimate of the span of art critical and art historical activity . Some authorities might argue for a shorter span , giving Baudelaire a title as father of modern art criticism or W�lflinn the key part in the development of art history . It is in the last hundred years or so that theories have been advanced to justify critical or art historical practice , the creation of such theories being made more urgent in the last fifty years by a struggle to establish and then uphold the status of art history as an academic discipline . The study of Oriental art in the West has fared less well . A firm basis for the study of Oriental art came more slowly , and as we shall see , some of the differences of approach between East and West still require wider recognition . Moreover , other cultures , such as those of Africa , have had to wait until even more recent times for recognition . It is literature within the last three centuries , then , that provides the main choices for a reader . The advice offered here is that a reader should ignore what category of writing a book or article may come under , since helpful art criticism may be found in all sorts of sources . There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's catalogue , or to neglect popular magazines ; as for writing in various academic disciplines , there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic . The reader 's question of a book or an article should be what function the writing is able or unable to perform ? Writing of many types may assist a reader who looks forward to an encounter with a work of art . A RULE OF THUMB It will by now have become evident that this book takes an unorthodox approach to art criticism . There will be no attempt to define exactly what art criticism is , or to set out a theory of criticism , beyond the suggestions of some differences in writings on art which have already been made . Nor will a history of art criticism be attempted . The stress of the book falls on a viewer 's encounter with a work of art , and how a prior reading of a piece of art criticism can improve that encounter . To put the matter in a slightly different way , reading art criticism is a preparation for an aesthetic event . James S. Ackerman , the architectural scholar , makes use of this phrase in writing about art and communication : " What a work of art communicates can be described only in terms of an interaction between an object and a subject ; it communicates nothing at all unless someone is there to look at it . In other words , there are no aesthetic objects , only physical objects , which , when observed , are capable of stimulating an aesthetic event . " We can return for a moment to talk to the girl who went to Italy , and was overwhelmed by Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel ceiling . Her idea of the value of art criticism was a simple one . In her mind there was a set of events which includes reading about a work of art and looking at it . There was a crucial sequence . Michelangelo painted the ceiling . Critics have visited the chapel and written about it . This writing was discovered by her ; she read some material before her visit , which prepared her a little for what she would see . When she came to writing for her college project , she found other material ; this will enable her to enjoy the work more fully on a second visit . In her reading about the Sistine Chapel , we can imagine our friend using a rule of thumb to distinguish what was helpful to her . According to this , art criticism has three indispensable elements . These are description , interpretation , and judgement . Walter Pater 's account of the Mona Lisa can be used as an example . The description is rather slender , but Pater was able to assume some existing knowledge on the part of his reader : " We all know the face and hands of the figure , set in its marble chair , in that circle of fantastic rocks , as in some faint light under sea . " Pater 's interpretation is justly celebrated , with its cornucopia of cultural references to Troy , Greece , Rome , the Middle Ages , as well as to Pagan gods and Christianity . It is a memorable evocation , casting a spell over the reader : " She is older than the rocks among which she sits ; like the vampire , she has been dead many times , and learned the secrets of the grave ; and has been a diver in deep seas , and keeps their fallen day about her ... " Pater 's judgement is decisive , that this picture is Leonardo 's masterpiece . Art criticism at its most helpful does not stint the reader of any one of these elements . As four chapters will demonstrate , there are different places to find art criticism ; a monograph will afford the greatest opportunity for full critical treatment , while a brief newspaper article is most likely to omit one or more of the three helpful elements , perhaps through the writer 's assuming prior knowledge on the reader 's part . To be aware of the limitations of different forms of publication is an advantage for the reader , who can by this means avoid unnecessary disappointments . Description , interpretation and judgement are the subjects of separate chapters , where they are considered in more detail . Without anticipating this fuller discussion , it is worth making two or three points immediately . Description is a heading which includes both a description of the work itself and of the critic 's response to it . Interpretation is the heading which is the most wide-ranging of the three elements , including questions of form or style , but perhaps additionally considering the work 's historical background , and technical , thematic or other questions , including the artist 's biography . The evaluation is a summing up which places the work in the experience of the critic , and helps the reader to form a judgement . The plan of the book , then , is simple . After the first two chapters , it discusses where and how to read art criticism . While this first chapter has outlined what that criticism is , the next gives sketches of half a dozen critical types . So , it is to the critics themselves we turn next . AMUSING AND POETIC : THE BEST CRITICISM A FATHER OF MODERN CRITICISM The qualities of a good critic are clear perception , fine sensibility and eloquence . These same qualities are needed by lecturers , so it is no surprise that some excellent critical writings , such as many of John Ruskin 's books , were first read out from a lectern . An art critic also needs a gift for persuasion , perhaps rather more than a head for exposition and argument . Evocative description can be an effective weapon in the armoury of a critic , besides which a light touch of wit or some conversational sparkle do no harm . We can start with Baudelaire , sometimes considered to be a father of modern criticism . He earned this disputable title by his thoughtful approach to critical issues and the undeniable distinction of his critical practice . His writings on art include several reviews of the Paris Salons , which were either published in booklets or in journals such as the Revue fran�aise . The custom of writing about the Salons was well established , and had inspired brilliant writing by such an important figure in the eighteenth century as Diderot . By the 1850s the tradition had declined , so that Baudelaire was seeking to give new life to a decayed literary genre . He asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times , careful to avoid hackneyed subjects . Typically , a laudatory essay he wrote was called The Painter of Modern Life on the subject of the illustrator Constantin Guys ; this gifted if minor artist was accurately targeted by Baudelaire as being in the mainstream of contemporary social and political life . Guys ' drawings appeared in such papers as the Illustrated London News , a very successful venture begun in 1842 , the decade which also saw the founding of satirical journals like Punch or Kladderadatsch . The illustrated periodical was a phenomenon of a world which Baudelaire saw as reborn on Guys ' paper : Natural and more than natural , beautiful and more than beautiful , strange and endowed with an impulsive life like the soul of its creator ... He is looking for that quality which you must allow me to call " modernity " ; for I know of no better word to express the idea I have in mind . He makes it his business to extract from fashion whatever element it may contain of poetry within history , to distil the eternal from the transitory ... By " modernity " I mean the ephemeral , the fugitive , the contingent , the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable . Modernity also had other manifestations . In his review for the Salon of 1846 , Baudelaire wrote : " To say Romanticism is to say modern art -- that is spirituality , colour , aspiration towards the infinite , expressed by every means available to the arts . " The real benefit of reading Baudelaire himself on the art of his contemporaries is the chance of recovering some of the excitement the poet felt . It is an additional pleasure to recognise his prophetic power of divining where the best art was to be found . Baudelaire argued for modernity , but he also strongly believed that a critic has the right to be partisan . He asserted the plain fact of the existence of differences in taste . In writing about Delacroix , he placed his hero in a pantheon of artists who were acknowledged masters of great decorative painting : Which is the greatest of these great men who differ so much from one another ? Each must decide as he pleases , according to whether his temperament urges him to prefer the prolific , radiant , almost jovial abundance of Rubens ; the mild dignity and eurhythmic order of Raphael ; the paradisal -- one might almost say the afternoon colour of Veronese ; the austere and strained severity of David ; or the dramatic and almost literary rhetoric of Lebrun . The critic , too , according to Baudelaire has a right to be independent , and to work without a system " which is a kind of damnation which forces one to a perpetual recantation " . He wrote : The best criticism is that which is both amusing and poetic ; not a cold , mathematical criticism which , on the pretext of explaining everything , has neither love nor hate , and voluntarily strips itself of every shred of temperament . But , seeing that a fine picture is nature reflected by an artist , the criticism which I approve will be that picture reflected by an intelligent and sensitive mind . Thus the best account of a picture may well be a sonnet or an elegy ... as for criticism properly so-called ... To be just , that is to say , to justify its existence , criticism should be partial , passionate and political , that is to say , written from an exclusive point of view that opens up the widest horizons . THE ADVOCATE A partial and passionate critic also writing in the middle of the nineteenth century was John Ruskin , as devoted to Turner as Baudelaire was to Delacroix . He may be taken as an example of a first type of critic , the advocate . Ruskin was a deeply observant man , a close student of the natural world , and capable of a profound and subtle interpretation of Turner 's art . This is a passage about The Slave Ship , painted by the artist in 1840 ; it comes from Modern Painters . It is a sunset on the Atlantic , after a prolonged storm ; but the storm is partially lulled , and the torn and streaming rain-clouds are moving in scarlet lines to lose themselves in the hollow of the night . The whole surface of the sea included in the picture is divided into two ridges of enormous swell , not high , not local , but a low broad heaving of the whole ocean , like the lifting of its bosom by deep-drawn breath after the torture of the storm . Between these two ridges the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea , dyeing it with an awful but glorious light , the intense and lurid splendour which burns like gold , and bathes like blood . Along this fiery path and valley , the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided , lift themselves in dark , indefinite , fantastic forms , each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam ... Purple and blue , the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night , which gathers cold and low , advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea , its thin mast written upon the sky , in lines of blood ... I believe , if I were reduced to rest Turner 's immortality upon any single work , I should choose this . Its daring conception , ideal in the highest sense of the word , is based on the purest truth , and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life , its colour is almost perfect , not one false or morbid hue in any part or line , and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition ; its drawing is as accurate as fearless ; the ship buoyant , bending , and full of motion ; its tones as true as they are wonderful ; and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions ... the power , majesty and deathfulness of the open , deep , illimitable sea . Ruskin wrote fluently and seriously , often at length . He was a successful lecturer , much in demand , and put lectures together to make up books ; certainly a book is the ideal medium for a critic 's extended advocacy of an artist . Nowadays appreciations are often condensed , perhaps into a catalogue introduction , or possibly fitted into the preface for a book of illustrations . These sites of criticism are cramping for persuasive advocacy , even if excellent use is sometimes made of them . The critic as advocate has been fortunate in twentieth-century France , where a climate of culture has brought art and literature together ; also art and philosophy , in the case of Jean-Paul Sartre 's advocacy of Giacometti , in whose emaciated figure sculptures the philosopher saw a metaphor of human struggle , even , as he wrote in an article in Les Temps modernes in 1948 , " the fleshless martyrs of Buchenwald " . The connections and friendships of Surrealism can also be instanced as opportunities for advocacy . Parisian cultural life between the wars was close-knit ; writers and artists gave each other mutual support . At the beginning of Surrealism it was argued that there was no Surrealist painting , but this dogma was soon reversed . Surrealist painting had publicity value , especially when executed by a showman like Salvador Dali , who married the former wife of the poet Paul �luard . The internal politics of Surrealism were complicated by rivalries and ideological disputes ; in the case of Andr� Breton 's association with Dali , his earlier support gave way to a denunciation of the artist , who was expelled from the group . Another famous figure , Joan Mir� , initially praised by Breton as " the most Surrealist " painter , later described his Surrealist phase as having lasted only for a matter of months . A personal friend of an artist may have a real advantage in writing criticism , as he may learn about artistic intentions which are not explained to others . This places a critic in a privileged position , but also with a responsibility to make clear whether views expressed are those of the critic or those of the artist . This distinction can be limpid if the artist is directly interviewed , and the interview is verbatim ; but there are problems of evidence with filming and tape recordings , as well as with interviews , since the viewer or reader is unlikely to know how they have been edited . THE PROGRESSIVE A second type of critic may be called the progressive . The archetype here is Guillaume Apollinaire , special pleader for modernism before the first World War . Apollinaire has been aptly called a company promoter of the avant-garde , responsible , as it were , for the successful flotations in Paris of Cubism and futurism . He welcomed the varied responses of artists and writers to modern life , and in his own poetry explored innovations . He believed that Paris was seeing a forward surge in the arts . Writing on were unaffected by French bourgeois taste . Like Apollinaire , they saw a rift between the old century and the new . Gertrude Stein later wrote a book on Picasso , in which she put the point like this : One must never forget that the reality of the twentieth century is not the reality of the nineteenth century , not at all and Picasso was the only one in painting who felt it , the only one . More and more the struggle to express it intensified . Matisse and all the others saw the twentieth century with their eyes but they saw the reality of the nineteenth century , Picasso was the only one in painting who saw the twentieth century with his eyes and saw its reality and consequently his struggle was terrifying , terrifying for himself and for the others , because he had nothing to help him , the past did not help him , nor the present , he had to do it all alone and , in spite of much strength he is often very weak , he consoled himself and allowed himself to be seduced by other things which led him more or less astray . In its slightly earlier day , pointillism had also had a progressive artistic programme . The critical promoter of the work of Seurat and his friends was F�lix F�n�on , a subtle stylist who varied his methods according to the work he was describing ; he used expository language for Degas , but he dropped logical connection in language , even verbs when discussing Monet 's spontaneous art . In arguing for pointillism , he quoted the scientific treatises consulted by Seurat and even printed mathematical equations . F�n�on possessed a dry wit , honed to a sharp edge by journalism ; he was a specialist in the sort of notes usually titled as " News in brief " , but in France called " faits divers " ( Sundry facts ) . He made these three-liners into sardonic comments which undercut the banalities of the newspaper in which they appeared . As a critic , his descriptions of paintings were phrased with exceptional care . For example , this is how he evoked Seurat 's scene of the Parisian suburban resort known as La Grande Jatte . " Beneath a sultry sky , at four o'clock , the island , boats slipping past its flank , stirring with a casual Sunday crowd enjoying the fresh air among the trees ; and these forty or so figures are endowed with a succinct , hieratic line ... The atmosphere is transparent and uncommonly vibrant ; the surface seems to flicker or glimmer . " F�n�on , like other excellent critics , was a valued friend of artists , and so he remained all his life even though he gave up writing criticism after a decade of working on the Revue blanche from 1893 to 1903 . He accepted a position in a dealer 's gallery , where Matisse was among the artists who benefited from his judgement . A thumbnail sketch by a friend brings F�n�on to life : " He did not thrust himself upon you . First of all , he knew how to listen -- which is very rare . But at the same time he was both transmitter and receiver , so to speak . He asked questions , and between his questions and the painter 's answers , there was a discovery of the painting itself . Even more , there was a sort of mimesis between F�n�on and the artist . " A friend to artists in England after the war in which Apollinaire had fought was another combatant , the poet and critic Herbert Read . In 1933 Read published an even-handed book called Art Now , eclectic in its selection , with discussions of Expressionism , Abstraction and Surrealism . Art Now had started life as a lecture series , but Read was a frequent reviewer of exhibitions , and a contributor to the Listener , from which some short essays were published under the title The Meaning of Art . Read was a progressive without being wholly partisan . He disobeyed Baudelaire 's instruction to be partial , or obeyed it only in so far as he took a stand against conservative taste . He did not take sides against Abstraction , even though he was one of the organisers of a Surrealist exhibition in London in 1937 . This was difficult to understand for impassioned artists who saw Surrealism and Abstraction as struggling for the soul of modern art . Read 's account of the work of Paul Klee is characteristic . He judged that it would be difficult to persuade readers of the artistry of Klee 's art , which appeared similar to children 's drawings , so he stressed the work 's imaginative content . This passage was written , incidentally , at a time when he was not well informed about Klee 's own ideas . It stands as a sympathetic appraisal by a critic who is trusting largely to his own intuitive sense of quality : He wants to suggest the exclusive nature of that subliminal world -- to dwell there , and to forget the conscious world . He wants to escape to the world of memory-residues , of disconnected images , for that is the world of fantasy , the world of fairy-tales and myths ... ( Klee 's art ) denies the reality or sufficiency of normal perception ... The eye of the artist is concentrated on his pencil ; the pencil moves and the line dreams . THE POLITICIAN A committed critic writes from a social , nationalist or political conviction , which interacts with an aesthetic response to a work of art . The extreme of critical judgement is to destroy the work concerned , as bulldozers destroyed a Russian exhibition of experimental art in 1974 ; or to forbid an artist to work , as was the practice in National Socialist Germany , where another form of criticism was used in 1937 by making an exhibition of art to be repudiated by its visitors . This exhibition of " degenerate art " in Munich showed Abstract and Constructivist paintings which were stated to express " total madness " and the " height of degeneracy " . National or political fervour can alternatively be the motor force of remarkable artistic achievements . The murals of Diego Rivera for the Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico City are admitted by the critic Antonio Rodriguez not to be all of an equally high standard , " but what poet could keep up the same lyrical flow for a thousand verses ? Among some of his frescoes there are some which are imprinted on the memory for ever . " In these 239 murals , covering a surface of 1,585 square metres , there are traces of many influences making up a popular and forceful imagery : " The codices , pre-conquest sculpture , popular art , the study of living people , the colour of nature as well as the paintings of the misnamed Italian Primitives , together with the modern artistic tendencies to which Rivera himself had contributed during his stay in France , all went to form his own peculiar style , which is apparent for the first time in these frescoes . " This is art , as Lenin wished , for the people . In the USSR itself , art flourished at first in experiments after the 1917 Revolution , but became confined to social utility after 1922 . Art was subordinated to a social theory , and the result was " Socialist Realism " , the realistic portrayal of heroic workers and everyday life in a representational style . " Socialist Realism " has been described by Ernst Fischer as implying " the artist 's or writer 's fundamental agreement with the aims of the working class and the emerging socialist world " ; in short , this is a stance of political progressivism . Commentary or criticism of such art within the country concerned necessarily takes the same position . In modern China an attempt has also been made to create a national art , in this instance by partly discrediting tradition . In 1942 Lu Hsun was quoted by Mao Tse-tung as asserting that the aim of a modern Chinese artist should be : " By selection to accept the historical legacy of Chinese traditional art ; to absorb the best style and technique from foreign art ; and thus to establish a new national art in accordance with the demands and needs of the masses . " Mao added : " To study the development of this old culture , to reject its feudal dross and assimilate its democratic essence , is a necessary condition of our new national culture . " The critical distinction between feudal dross and democratic essence subsequently proved difficult to make . This brief diversion into the cultural and political history of Germany , the USSR and China has been made to emphasise the way that a state may determine artistic production , and thence art criticism . In other political states during the twentieth century , there has been strong support for the view that art should serve a social purpose . This took such forms as the praise of regionalism in the United States in the 1930s , Marxist criticism in London or New York , or Communist positions taken by Italian critics after the Second World War . An English critic who attempted the task of keeping a balance between his political convictions and his aesthetic responses was John Berger , who wrote in the 1950s for the New Statesman . He argued against an excessively formalist type of analysis of art , by pointing out how everyday emotions and ideas also affect the viewer of paintings or sculpture . Many of his readers approved his sensitive and appreciative understanding of paintings , though without sharing his political views . THE COMPILER A fourth type of critic can be called the compiler , whose criticism is implied in choices for collections or exhibitions . The compiler 's main critical medium is the catalogue , and rather less often articles or a book . Alfred Barr , the first director of the Museum of Modern Art , New York , is exemplary . In 1936 , for example , the Museum put on two crucially important exhibitions , on Cubist and Abstract Art , and Fantastic Art , Dada , Surrealism . For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to write a historical essay , but it was Barr 's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair . In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself , Barr 's commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art : The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep-seated and persistent interest which human beings have in the fantastic , the irrational , the spontaneous , the marvellous , the enigmatic , and the dreamlike . These qualities have always been present in the metaphors and similes of poetry but they have been less frequent in painting , which in the past was largely concerned with reproducing external reality , with decoration , or , as in the more advanced movements of recent years , with the composition of color and line into formal design . On Dada he wrote : " With robust iconoclastic humor the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture . They even attacked art -- especially " modern art " -- but while they made fun of the pre-War Cubists , Expressionists and futurists , they borrowed and transformed many of the principles and techniques of these earlier movements . " Barr , in what used to be a general policy for museum curators , was not writing a passionate defence of the work his museum exhibited . Rather , " the Museum does not intend to sponsor a particular aspect of modern art , but rather to make a report to the public by offering material for study and comparison " . Barr 's European equivalents flourished in the 1950s rather than the 1930s -- Jean Cassou at the Mus�e d'Art Moderne in Paris , Wilhelm Sandberg at the Stedlijk in Amsterdam , Pontus Hulten at the Modern Museum in Stockholm and then at the Pompidou Centre in Paris . These men were taste-makers , whose judgements were important ; but the time available to them for writing was limited by the demands of negotiation and administration , so that they tended to write essays more than books , catalogue entries rather than articles . THE TRADITIONALIST Some stress has been thrown thus far on modernism and its advocacy , but a traditional critic may write as well or better than a modernist . Our fifth type must therefore be the traditionalist , for whom it is a pleasure to find the past living on in the present . A traditional critic has the advantage of being able to turn to standards and values inherited from the past . The highest praise can be given to works which match up and accord with these . A traditional critic may be a practising artist ; if so , there is an excellent chance that any technical assessment included in a piece of criticism will be thorough . Joshua Reynolds ' comparison of Michelangelo with Raphael can serve us as an example : Michelangelo 's works have a strong , peculiar and marked character : they seem to proceed from his own mind entirely , and that mind so rich and abundant , that he never needed , or seems to disdain , to look abroad for foreign help . Raphael 's materials are generally borrowed , though the noble structure is his own . The excellency of this extraordinary man lay in the propriety , beauty , and majesty of his characters , the judicious contrivance of his composition , his correctness of drawing , purity of taste , and skilful accommodation of other men 's conceptions to his own purpose . Nobody excelled him in that judgement , with which he united his own observations on nature , the energy of Michelangelo , and beauty and simplicity of the antique . To the question , therefore , which ought to hold the first rank , Raphael or Michelangelo , it must be answered , that if it is to be given to him who possessed a greater combination of the higher qualities of the art than any other man , there is no doubt but Raphael is the first . But if , as Longinus thinks , the sublime , being the highest excellence that human composition can attain to , abundantly compensates the absence of every other beauty , and atones for all other deficiencies , then Michelangelo demands the preference . Reynolds was here addressing students at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1772 . It was the fifth of those lectures he gave from 1769 to 1790 , known as his fifteen discourses . In them he took " every opportunity of recommending a rational method of study " , and incidentally inculcating his views of sound critical taste ; it would have been a brave student who dared to admire Carlo Maratta , after hearing that he had : no great vigour of mind or strength of original genius . He rarely seizes the imagination by exhibiting the higher excellencies , nor does he captivate us by that originality which attends the Painter who thinks for himself . He knew and practised all the rules of art , and from a composition of Raphael , Carracci , and Guido , made up a style , of which the only fault was , that it has no manifest defects and no striking beauties ; and that the principles of his composition are never blended together , so as to form one uniform body original in its kind , or excellent in any view . Reynolds was a notable conversationalist , well able to stand up to his friends , who included Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke . It is in this more informal context that his draft for a sixteenth and ironical discourse should be read . It attacks his constant enemy , the idea of genius : Gentlemen : It is with great regret that I see so many students labouring day after day in the Academy , as if they imagined that a liberal art , such as ours , was to be acquired like a mechanical trade , by dint of labour , or I may add the absurdity of supposing that it could be acquired by any means whatever . We know that if you are born with genius , labour is unnecessary ; if you have it not , labour is in vain ; genius is all in all . It was wittily said by a bright genius , who observed another to labour in the composition of a discourse he was to deliver in public , that such a painstaker was fitter to make a pulpit than to preach in it . Genius , as it disdains all assistance , so it defies all obstacles . The student here may inform himself whether he has been favoured by heaven with this truly divine gift . If he finds it necessary to copy , to study the work of other painters , or any way to seek for help out of himself , he may be sure that he has received nothing of that inspiration . Reynolds ' weighty irony was wielded with more address than arguments put forward by later traditionalists . But his views were dismaying to one of the readers of his discourses , the poet and artist William Blake . " Having spent the Vigour of my Youth and Genius under the Oppression of Sir Joshua & his Gang of Cunning Hired Knaves Without Employment & as much as could possibly be Without Bread , the Reader must Expect to Read in all my Remarks on these Books Nothing but Indignation and Resentment . " As to genius , " Reynolds " opinion was that Genius may be taught & that all Pretense to Inspiration is a Lie & a Deceit , to say the least of it . For if it is a Deceit , the whole Bible is Madness . This Opinion originates with the Greeks ' calling the Muses Daughters of Memory . " THE THEORETICIAN The last type of critic to be distinguished in the present chapter will be the theoretician . Today , theory is in high fashion at Western universities , and varied in scope . Literary theory , drawing on other disciplines , including semiotics and linguistics , seeks for underlying structures and meanings in literature . The medium of an art critic as theoretician is the magazine or journal article , not necessarily in a publication specialising in art . theories are interdisciplinary , and the specific quality of a painting or a sculpture may not be spotlighted by the theoretician , whose writing is likely to be long on interpretation but short on description . A theoretician is well prepared to consider what the most apt questions about works of art may be . There is , after all , a rich plurality of means and intents in a painting . Paul Val�ry wrote that a painter : has brought together , accumulated and assimilated by means of the physical materials of his art a host of desires , intentions , and conditions coming from all regions of his mind and being . Sometimes he was thinking of his model , sometimes of the mixing of his pigments , his tone , his oils ; sometimes of the flesh itself and sometimes of the absorbent canvas . But , though independent , these objects of his attention coalesced , inevitably , in the act of painting when all the discrete , scattered moments , followed up , caught on the wing , suspended or elusive , were in process of becoming the picture on the easel . Even such richness may not be enough for a theoretician . Victor Burgin explained , for example , in The End of Art Theory that he was unwilling to be limited to an aesthetic response to " the art object , which in turn is representative of the sensibility of the artist " . He described this aesthetic response as the bed-rock of conservative criticism . For him , critical writing has to take up wider issues than enjoyment of a picture or a sculpture . A different sort of response to art is to use it as a means of learning more about the society in which it was produced ; this may be felt by a theoretician to be more important than to know the artist 's intentions , which , it can be argued , are determined by society . Or , the effect of a painting may be compared with those of other means of communication , such as photography , film or television . there is every reason to welcome such studies , though a reader hoping for judgements about quality may be disappointed by a theoretical writer 's greater stress on interpretation . Theorists may also be more difficult to follow in their arguments because of a current of polemic with which a reader may not be familiar . For example , the writing of Rosalind Krauss has mainly been published in two journals , the American October and the French Macuba , both advancing a special interpretation of twentieth-century art . This stance is partly a reaction against what Krauss saw as a dominant position in American criticism , by which " the art of the last hundred and thirty years , the art of modernism , is not being well served by writing that promotes the myths through which it can be consistently misread " . Her particular target for attack was the formalist interpretation of abstract art by Clement Greenberg . Post-modernist interpretations evolved in her articles between 1973 and 1983 , and were published in The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths in 1987 . One of the articles is about the abstract artist Sol LeWitt , who was in Krauss 's opinion misinterpreted by three critics as serving " as triumphant illustration of the powers of human reason . And , we might ask , what else could Conceptual Art be ? " How such as Donald Judd and Robert Smithson , was that they saw " a false and pious rationality " as " the enemy of art " . From her knowledge of the artists ' attitudes to their work , she pointed to the part that uncertainties played in the process of making their sculpture . AERIAL VIEW : SURVEYS CHRONOLOGICAL SURVEYS " The White Rabbit had put on his spectacles , but he did not know where to start . " Begin at the beginning , " the King said gravely , " and go on till you come to the end : then stop . " ? Many art books follow this plan , especially those aiming to take in a national culture or a whole civilisation . Art histories often make an attempt to keep to chronology , although the difficulties include the crucial fact that in art there is no clear sequence of events . Unlike old-fashioned narrative history , art has no decisive battles , no international treaties , and no changes of government . This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight appear . Newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about different aspects of the past , such as social conditions . Deciding where is the beginning can be a trouble for an art historian . In Europe , classical times are a beginning for historians , but not for archaeologists . For some art historians , the Renaissance is a new beginning , though medievalists can point out convincingly that no one event divides the Middle Ages from the Renaissance . In writings about the Renaissance , its beginning may be seen to waver from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century . One of the major accounts of the Renaissance in Italy was published in 1860 by a Swiss history professor at Basel University . Jacob Burckhardt sensibly avoids pedantry about a starting date , but stresses the revival of antiquity as a main characteristic of the period . His book entitled The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy avoids a chronological sequence , since his plan of arrangement was to build up a mosaic of characteristic material . As he explained : " My starting point has to be a vision , otherwise I can not do anything . Vision I call not only optical , but also spiritual realization ; for instance , historical vision issuing from the old sources . " A more mundane project for a survey writer is to scan Western art , which has often been attempted in series of books , many of them , as Roger Fry 's comments implied , by German historians . A few single volumes have had deserved success . One of the best was made out of lectures at the �cole du Louvre by the French historian Salomon Reinach , first published in English in 1904 ( with 600 illustrations ) . An American work on the same lines was first published in 1926 by Helen Gardner . She called it Art Through the Ages . Neither of these works , nor two more which are to be discussed , have attempted to integrate Eastern with Western art . The limitations of surveys can be demonstrated by two examples of well-respected books . A subtle mind and a firm editorial hand were essential ingredients in the success of The Story of Art by E. H. Gombrich , first published in 1950 . Gombrich 's book is a fine example of a survey , ambitious in scope , clear-sighted in its emphasis on the history of styles , and judicious in appraisals of the work of individual artists . It is relatively brief , as can be seen by comparing it with a more recent competitor for the same market , H. W. Janson 's A History of Art , which is more than twice the length and has more illustrations ( 928 in 1962 ) . Both surveys contain art criticism ; Janson uses his advantage of extra space to include more quotations from artists . For example , this is a passage of interpretive description of a Van Gogh self-portrait : " ... his emaciated , luminous head with its burning eyes set off against a whirlpool of darkness . " I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize , " Van Gogh had written , groping to define for his brother the human essence that was his aim in pictures such as this . " In other passages , the reader may find more difficulty in following Janson 's judgement . Here is a passage which shows that a survey can benefit from being used with other books ( even though three of the sculptures mentioned are illustrated by Janson ) . Antoine Coysevox , a less self-conscious classicist than Girardon , was another sculptor employed by Lebrun at Versailles . In his large stucco relief in the Salon de Guerre , the victorious Louis XIV retains the pose of Bernini 's equestrian statue . Coysevox 's bust of Lebrun repeats -- again with a certain restraint -- the general outlines of Bernini 's bust of Louis XIV . The face , however , shows a realism and subtlety of characterization that are Coysevox 's own . He is the first of a long line of distinguished French portrait sculptors . Without comparative material , the reader is in serious difficulty about knowing whether to agree with this three-way discriminative judgement . Gombrich 's scholarly work includes many papers on meaning and interpretation in the visual arts , so that the broad but thin scope of his story of art is instructive ; by writing a survey he inevitably limited himself to a narrow range of comment . His book stresses the history of styles , which he describes in sequence , Baroque for example being followed by Rococo , and Neo-classicism . An unwary reader might think that the book is a history of the changes in Western art , whereas it is in fact only a selection of some changes . The Story of Art highlights change and development , sadly at the expense of art which is less varied , of however high a quality . In other words , stylistic change is at a premium ; in Gombrich 's book the dramatic innovations of Caravaggio do well , but a distinguished painter , say Bonnard , who is not so bold or challenging an artist was omitted until additions were made to the text in 1971 . As for a varied painter , only one work is likely to appear in a survey . The imperative for a writer of a chronological survey is that a defined period of time is covered ; this may be linked with a theme , such as the history of styles in Gombrich 's case , but it is unlikely to be linked solely with a spotlight on quality . Excellence is not necessarily a criterion for including a picture or a sculpture in a chronological survey . The author may choose to use a characteristic work , something typical of its time and place . A work of outstanding quality is a pinnacle ; it is not typical . There are also technical limitations . A well-known picture book of Italian art alone contains more than 4,000 reproductions , yet histories of art , as we have seen , contain fewer , sometimes much fewer than 1,000 plates . Of the illustrations in any general book relatively few are in colour ; a careful author is bound to consider which works suffer least from being reproduced in black and white . Again , the need for the deeply interested reader to supplement a survey with other books becomes evident . The presenter of a television series has some advantage over a writer , since filming is more flexible than book production . A demonstration of the point is to compare Civilisation by Kenneth Clark in its forms as television and book . The television series is a much richer visual experience , and filming has a completely decisive advantage in being able to explore architecture , inside and out . Nevertheless , the limitations of writing a script to accompany images on the screen become clear on the printed page . The pace of television favours simplifications , generalised statements , witticisms , and short sharp judgements on artists ' performances . A presenter , after all , knows that a viewer has the visual evidence to check on what is being said . As for planning , drama is relished in television , no doubt an incentive for Clark to describe the precarious survival of Western civilisation in an episode on the Dark Ages as being saved by " the skin of our teeth " . Some commentators have complained that Clark 's title , Civilisation , was misleading , as only Western arts were treated ; but even if Clark had been willing to take on world art , costs would no doubt have prevented such a grandiose project . A single-volume history has recently been courageously and skilfully attempted by Hugh Honour and John Fleming , which inevitably suffers from the problem of compression . Other civilisations are treated in separate studies . One parallel to the scope of Janson 's book on Western art , Sherman Lee 's A History of Far Eastern Art , was first published in 1964 . This contains sixty colour plates and 656 black and white plates . Lee makes firm judgements , as in this comment on a cave painting from the seventh century : " The most famous figure at Ajanta is in Cave 1 and has been often described as the " Beautiful Bodhisattva " . It represents Padmapani holding a blue lotus , and is located at one side of a cell entrance . the figure is much destroyed from the waist down ; but the noble torso , and especially the head , express that compassion and humility which is the great achievement of Buddhist art . " What is true for general histories also applies to surveys of more limited periods . A typical decision for planning a survey is to take a century , or the reign of some sovereign to delimit a period ; this is a device with no relationship to the artistic activity of the time . In our rapidly vanishing century , decades are also taken as periods of time to be commemorated . In a dispassionate view , a century seems to have several advantages , as being more than a lifespan and being an evident but arbitrary division . Art is not alone in failing to conform contentedly to such chronological schemes , indeed , some might say that poetry or music are even less amenable . An alternative to dates is to use a term like Romantic , even if its meaning seems to alter from writer to writer . Who means today what Baudelaire meant ? Attempting to capture the spirit of a period is another planning strategy for a survey , though this philosophical notion of a Zeitgeist is notoriously elusive . It is perhaps more the stuff of epigrams than analysis . The idea that there is such a thing as the spirit of a time can be awkwardly challenged by asking , " Whose time ? " No prizes can be offered for pointing out that at a given moment there are artists of several generations working and in very different ways . A further , and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists . " Art history without names " was a phrase used by Heinrich W�lflinn , in his introduction to The Principles of Art History first published in 1915 . W�lflinn was Burckhardt 's successor as professor at Basel , but his later successful career took him to Berlin , Munich and Z�rich , a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque . W�lflinn was naturally not ignorant of artists , but the famous phrase indicated an interest in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition . W�lflinn 's writings are strong on observation ; this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ; linear as against painterly , plane surface as against recessional depth , closed against open form , composite clarity against fused clarity , or absolute clarity against relative clarity . Such polarities were evidently valuable aids to several generations of W�lflinn 's pupils who could benefit from his personal teaching as well as the rather more rigid theory in his books . W�lflinn used such terms to distinguish epochs ; they are only partly useful as interpretation , since W�lflinn tended to be more interested in art as an independent phenomenon than as having meaning intended by the artist . W�lflinn wrote Renaissance and Baroque in 1888 , which in the preface he described as follows : The subject of this study is the disintegration of the Renaissance . It is intended to be a contribution to the history of style rather than of individual artists . My aim was to investigate the symptoms of decay and perhaps to discover in the " capriciousness and the return to chaos " a law which would vouchsafe one an insight into the intimate workings of art . This , I confess , is to me the real aim of art history . In 1964 Peter Murray wrote an introduction to a new edition , in which he made an observation about the passage on Bernini 's St Teresa , the sculptural group in Rome which is a key work of the Baroque : Bernini is evidently attempting to render something quite transcendental and something which had never been attempted by a sculptor before that date . Indeed , it is possible to argue that St Teresa 's mystical ecstasies are themselves something entirely new in the spiritual life of Europe ... W�lflinn himself describes the Bernini statues at some length but at no point does he ever mention the subject ... W�lflinn was trying to isolate a visual denominator which , he claimed , was common to all works produced at the same time . The history of forms in art has had some distinguished advocates , some of whom have been concerned with the transformation over time of one form to another ; others have been more attracted to problems of values , arguing either that styles in art change and decay , or that in a particular period there is an artistic will to produce work in a style of its own . These are matters which border on philosophy . Eternal values can also be sought in art , as they were by the French art historian �lie Faure , whose open mind accepted disparate arts , a view which he expressed like this : " It is not paradoxical at all to affirm that an Ivory Coast mask and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel express the same need to manifest a harmonious rapport which exists between mankind and the universe . " A reader today can judge the validity of these claims through the means of photography . Extensive records enable us to visit what Andr� Malraux called a Mus�e imaginaire , in which the arts of many cultures and civilisations can be compared . Malraux 's books , like thousands of picture books since , emphasise details and similarities across boundaries of time and place . Photographs can reduce the scale of a monument or enlarge a detail for scrutiny . The unfriendly comment of Edgar Wind in Art and Anarchy was : " What has optimistically been called a " museum without walls ' " is in fact a museum on paper -- a paper-world of art in which the epic oratory of Malraux proclaims , with the voice of a crier in the market place , that all art is composed in a single key , that huge monuments and small coins have the same plastic eloquence if transferred to the scale of the printed page , that a gouache can equal a fresco . " GUIDE BOOKS A tourist may ask many questions about an unfamiliar scene . The answers include history , perhaps technology and sometimes art criticism . There is no shortage of guide books in the modern world , nor of travel books which regale readers with accounts of what travellers have seen . Occasionally a book has almost achieved immortality , like John Ruskin 's Stones of Venice , but even more modest books can call up the spirit of a place ; and a private letter may illuminate both a person and a work of art . It is easy to sympathise with a traveller who writes : " I have seen a quantity of things here -- churches , palaces , statues , fountains and pictures ; and my brain is at the moment like the portfolio of an architect , or a print-shop , or a common-place book . " This is from one of the letters written by Shelley in Italy , which goes on to describe the painting of St Cecilia by Raphael : You forget that it is a picture as you look at it ... There is a unity and perfection in it of an incommunicable kind . The central figure , St Cecilia , seems rapt in such inspiration as produced her image in the painter 's mind ; her deep , dark , eloquent eyes lifted up ; her chestnut hair flung back from her forehead -- she holds an organ in her hands -- her countenance , as it were , calmed by the depth of its passion and rapture , and penetrated throughout with the warm and radiant light of life . So vivid a response by a great poet must inspire respect and possibly a curiosity to see if the reader can match the experience . Guide books customarily take a lesser role , informing the traveller and listing things to see . These functions have been well carried out by Baedeker guides since the foundation of the German firm in the first part of the nineteenth century . Old copies are now collectors " items , with their entertaining instructions and hints . In 1909 : " The unattached cyclist on entering Italy with his wheel must deposit 42 fr . 60c . with the custom-house authorities , which sum is returned to him ( though seldom without difficulties ) when he quits the country . " Baedeker acquired a reputation for serious standards , and the traveller who missed a double-asterisked attraction had clearly journeyed in vain . Baedeker in 1909 , like Reynolds in his fifth discourse , hesitated between two great masters and their works . " Whether the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or the Stanze of Raphael should be regarded as the culminating effort of modern art , has long been the subject of controversy " ; but they both received double asterisks . A star system in guide books is still common practice today . As art criticism , it has the merit of making a judgement , though description and interpretation may be meagre . Some rankings have more than the approval of the author of a guide , and are attested by other authorities , local or even national . In Czechoslovakia works of importance are graded as national treasures , and while the Japanese have a similar system , they also rank places . For example , the shrine of Miyajima , a temple approached by water through a famous red gateway , ranks number three in Japan . More informal guidance can be found in books with a personal approach , in which class the Companion Guide to Rome by Georgina Masson is exemplary ( first published in 1965 ) . There is adequate historical data about the Sistine Chapel , but there is also a personal response : More , probably , has been written about this great hall-like chapel than any other building in the world ; but in fact no description , picture or photograph conveys the impact which it makes . Perhaps the first , and in the end the most lasting , impression that one carries away , is of the contrast between the golden-cream light and space and the exquisite feeling of harmony engendered by the ceiling as opposed to the deep blue darkness and turmoil of the " Last Judgment " . Georgina Masson 's special gift was her ability to disentangle and evoke in Rome three different cities , of Classical Antiquity , of the Renaissance , and of the Baroque . Not every city would be suited to this approach , it must be admitted . In Rome a visitor can stand in front of a Baroque church , but a few minutes later , having walked only a short distance , may have plunged back in time to Antiquity . This is not true in Philadelphia , where a new city decisively overwhelms the old . The Liberty Bell and the Court House are attractions which repay attention , but have far less power of historical recall . Guide books are arranged to suit the convenience of the traveller , for whom routes round a city or a site are often suggested . In an art museum , the works may be described from room to room , whether in a book or on a sound guide . A sound guide has an edge over the printed page , since the listener is looking at what is being described , interpreted and judged . However , the limitation of the sound guide is equally evident : only a small number of works can be given such exceptional treatment . GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEYS The tourist may find guide books excellent value , but an armchair traveller may be better served in other ways . A favourite choice is a book selected on geographical lines , say on Egypt , Mexico , or China , to mention three civilisations ; France , Australia , or Brazil , to take three nations ; and Norwich , the Hudson River , or Tuscany to name three areas . Books on any of these topics are likely to have a chronological framework , but the first principle of selection is place . The art discussed may still be in situ , or at least in the country of its origin ; hence the immense attraction of travel to the sites of great civilisations such as Egypt or Mexico . Surveys of art on geographical lines are a commonplace of policy for publishers . Among recent successes is the notable pelican series , whose titles are varied between civilisations ( say , Japan ) , countries ( say , France , 1500 -- 1700 ) , and international themes ( Ars Sacra , about medieval Christendom ) . The art criticism in such books generally has a slant , questioning whether the country or places have had a determining influence on art . Robert Paine , writing in the Pelican volume on Japan , had an answer : There can be no doubt that the climate of Japan imposed on her artists a different attitude towards art problems . The city of Kyoto , the imperial capital , lies surrounded by hills and is frequently bathed in mists . The visibility , lower than that of the drier climate of many parts of China , has caused the artist in Japan to be more concerned with the strength of outline than with the subtleties of depth sought for by his Chinese neighbour . The decorative flatness and the higher colour of Japanese art also follow as products of the same climatic necessity . Similar passages of critical reflection or speculation can be found in many books . Formal differences in art have been linked to places in varied ways , one of the best-known Renaissance contrasts being the stress on line evident in Florentine art as against the colourist approach of the Venetians , a city on water . Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country 's climate ? Does the flat landscape of the Netherlands impose a special sort of vision on Dutch artists ? The reverse of the coin is internationalism , a feature , some might say , of twentieth-century art ; not so uncommon either in other periods , where art historians struggle heroically to identify differences between the art of one country and another . Some of these struggles have been inspired by base motives -- desires to appropriate art to a national or a political cause . But some such efforts can have sympathy , as in those stirrings of national spirit in central Europe before 1914 , when literature , language and music were fuel for Czech , Polish or Hungarian aspirations . Consider Czech art , which might be said to have existed only since the beginning of the Czechoslovak state after the first World War . The beauty and achievements of Bohemian art can perhaps be called Czech only with an effort , but there is no doubt of the attachment of a people to the heritage that they can rightly claim . Yet Prague was always an international city , whose culture was dependent on native and external traditions alike . Let us walk with a visitor through the city , a veteran of the Second World War who values it as one which was almost unscathed from the bombing which devastated so many European cities . He starts at a medieval Gothic window , a remnant of the first university in central Europe ( founded 1348 ) ; he pauses at the rebuilt Bethlehem Chapel , the site of where the Mass was first allowed in Czech , and Jan Hus preached before being burnt for heresy in 1413 ; he pays respects to the relics of the Jewish quarter with its ancient and crowded graveyard ; to cross the river he uses the Charles Bridge , lined with Baroque statues ( many between 1700 and 1720 ) , and climbs the hill to the Castle where art and architecture of all periods again further embellish the golden city of central Europe . In the evening our friend has supper in the art nouveau interior of the Hotel Europe , before going to a performance at the National Theatre , built in the 1880s as a monument to the Czech national spirit , pinioned under the Austro-Hungarian Empire . As he has enjoyed his day , he sleeps soundly without a nightmare about what was specifically Czechoslovak in the sights . The truth is that nationality in art has limited importance . At no time will this be more true than in the 1990s , when the art critic confronts an increasingly international community of art . Of course , surveys will continue to be written about American painting or German art , British sculpture or Australian print-making ; this fact of publication does not mean that these activities have an inner coherence . Any reader is entitled to ask what purpose such national anthologies serve ; their best justification is making art more accessible , enabling those living artists represented to find and hold on to audiences for their work . The reader can beware of an element of self-interest in such anthologies , whether in the form of books or exhibitions . For one thing , a government agency may have commercial or political aims in commissioning surveys or anthologies . An international cultural agreement is made in parallel with a trading agreement ; trade , it is hoped , will follow the art exhibition . Not a new situation , for there are ample historical parallels . For the reader , however , an art defined as national , made as cohesive and marketable as possible , may be less than convincing as an entity ; it may be that within a survey or an anthology there are just a limited number of interesting and attractive works . SURVEYS OF TECHNIQUES Surveys of technique often include more rewarding art criticism than either chronologically or geographically based books . The writer is able to measure artists not only against each other but also against standards of technical achievement . Here is a passage from a classic work on etching and engraving , about D�rer : He was solid , scientific , conscious in all his creating , learning his art from masters who were still in the youth of artistic development , his whole work shows a progress towards an ideal which the trammels of Gothic tradition never left him free to attain without a struggle . By the very energy spent in its realisation , his accomplishment is all the more intense in its expression . He recognised the truest limits of the medium in which he worked , never allowed technical virtuosity to have the better of the central aim of significant composition , and established a balanced style which remains the most perfect model of the line-engraver 's art . The author is the English scholar Arthur Hind . His working life was spent in the British Museum , whose print collection was his special care . He first published a short history at the beginning of the century , but the passage quoted comes from the enlarged edition of 1923 . In discussing D�rer , he treated him as the most versatile artist of a triumvirate , whose other members were Marcantonio Raimondi and Lucas van Leyden . Of the latter he wrote , " Lucas van Leyden is an artist of frailer calibre than D�rer , and prone to lose himself in imitation of stronger men , each of his contemporaries in turn dominating his style . " Another book about the age of D�rer , but on a different topic , is The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany , by Michael Baxandall , published in 1980 . The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum , where there is an important group of this sculpture ; his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures . Divisions in the book are unusually clear , separate chapters being given to topics such as function , the market , or the historical and political background of the subject . He makes a particular point of technique . In the chapter on technique the author describes the process of carving a figure from a wood with particular properties . First the hard heartwood was removed , making the intended figure hollow at the back ; the sculptor avoided solid masses , unstable in wood ( though preferred by sculptors in a material like sandstone ) ; finally in the carving , forms were decided partly to avoid the hazards of the sapwood shrinking and splitting . Limewood is contrasted with oak , and the chapter finishes : The properties of the material made limewood sculpture a special medium . It was a medium of the grand form and of the surface , whether polychrome or monochrome ; it was not a positive medium of the middle forms , like oak , or even usually of the assertive instrument , as bronze can be . The grand form offered a scale of more or less assimilation to the form hidden in the wood , the surface a scale of textures , on both of which the sculptors played , and they are a source of specific qualities of the genre . A final chapter is devoted to four case studies : Michael Erhart of Ulm , Tilmann Riemenschneider of Wurzburg , Veit Stoss of Nuremberg , and Hans Leinberger of Landshut . These short studies are in part historical , but partly art criticism ; the study of Leinberger is particularly relevant , as it comments both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problems of reading about it . The best preliminary plan may be for the reader to open the book upright at ( the illustration ) and then go to the other side of the room , to be imposed on from a distance : it is the nearest the book can offer to the proper first encounter with the figure . There is no one way of looking at a sculpture by Leinberger and similarly there is no one angle or distance from which we see it anything like whole , but there is something like a normal sequence of approach . This begins with the figure impinging powerfully from a distance , in this case as one walks into St Martin 's at Landshut , more powerfully than other things in the field of view . What carries most punch here is , of course , the gilt y-shaped motif of the folds offered by the Virgin 's mantle ... to stretch a phrase , a Leinberger sculpture is a permanent possibility of cumulative sensation . For , once we have made the first approach to the Landshut Virgin and acquired a first set of impressions , the changeableness of the figure begins to work on us further , now less in the dimension of greater or lesser distance and more in the angle of view . In comparison , " One 's relation to Riemenschneider 's Altar of the Holy Blood is a little passive : one waits and the shift of light will change its mood and meaning . " This extended critical evaluation is a rarity in a survey , but very welcome in the way it spells out a connoisseur 's response in formal terms to a work of art . It has the added value of being firmly rooted in a thorough understanding of technique . Surveys of painting , it has to be admitted , are more fallible in this respect , partly because of the relative simplicity of the means used . Differences exist between the media of tempera and oil , or oil and acrylic , but they do not have the importance of contrasts in other material processes . Nevertheless , there is one group of surveys of painting which have a special interest : those which form part of handbooks or , more grandly , treatises on how to paint . A practitioner 's assessment of other artists ' work , often in the light of making similar attempts , can make intriguing reading . Drawings are quite often given survey treatment . The specialist field of old master drawings has received extremely detailed study ; the drawings are interesting both in their own right and as a means of knowing more about artists ' practices . The connoisseur also hopes to have in a drawing an authentic work by an artist 's own hand , which in the case of an oil painting may not be so assured . European studio practice from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century included the master 's employment of assistants , and the use of specialists for parts of pictures , such as drapery or landscape . Watercolours are also treated in surveys . Here the writer is likely to be a practitioner , and the approach may defer to the popularity of the medium as a pastime for amateurs . Print-making has had the advantage of some careful scholars , but an excellent book is by a practitioner , Stanley Hayter . It is modestly titled About Prints . In it this English master printmaker wrote lucidly and well about the range of possibilities in his profession . His memories of his Paris studio add spice to his account , for the facilities there were used not only by his students but in addition by such major artists as Mir� and Picasso . The technical survey is above all a category of book in which the writer will have closely observed the material discussed . This observation has direct bearing on questions of authenticity , since a detail may be the way that the true can be separated from the false . William J. Ivins was curator of prints at the Metropolitan Museum from 1916 to 1946 . In How Prints Look , first published in 1943 , he wrote " an elementary introduction to the appearances ( the outward and visible signs ) of prints " , and cautioned that : " Most of the time spent over it should be given to looking at its pictures . " The caption material under two images reads as follows : " In the middle nineteenth century , before photography was in general use , Pilinski of Paris was famous ( and notorious ) for the deceptiveness of his copies of old woodcuts . This is an enlargement from an original fifteenth-century woodcut . On the opposite page is Pilinski 's wood-engraved copy . " " Pilinski had to redraw his copy of the old and valuable original because he could not paste the original on his block and engrave through it . Every line is different -- every line is stupid -- and the whole character has changed . In a number of places Pilinski completely misunderstood the " indications " of the original . " THE SURVEY WITH A THEME Themes in art have a fascination , since they add a subject interest to a viewer 's enjoyment of artistic qualities . The portrait is an endlessly interesting example , a theme redolent with social connotations and artistic references . In Dostoevsky 's opinion , " The portrait painter seeks the moment when the model looks most like himself ; in the capacity to find and hold this moment lies also the talent of the portraitist . " The novelist in search of character thus finds a fellow-worker in the painter . This hope for a natural quality in portraits , however , is frequently disappointed , since many sitters are eager to be flattered . A powerful sitter may also impose a requirement that the portrait looks impressive , so that an amused spectator can look for traces of the consequent power struggle in a picture ; Queen Elizabeth I of England was as firm as the Emperor Augustus about the principle that a ruler 's actual appearance matters less than the imprint of authority . The artist 's self-portrait is a special case in portraiture and deservedly part of the collecting policy of art museums including the Uffizi , Florence . A successful description of a self-portrait may not be difficult , but an illuminating interpretation may call on many references , especially other artists ' pictures of themselves . What can be deduced from a self-portrait is often controversial ; a critic is especially likely to read into a self-portrait some opinion held about the artist . When , as in the cases of Rembrandt and Van Gogh , there is a whole series of pictures to choose from , books can be written on the self-images of one artist alone . This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's writing , since it tempts the rash into speculation , while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons . A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child . Again , much interest attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists . An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs to be considered as devotional imagery , and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits . An extremist view expressed by a twentieth-century artist is what Matisse had to say about his responses to murals by Giotto . " When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me , but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and color . The title will only serve to confirm my impression . " In a different context , but also on the issue of religion , an American book on the Aztecs by the archaeologist Vaillant commented tartly : The Aztecs did not have a term for " fine arts " , nor did they speculate about aesthetics , nor make objects to be contemplated for their beauty alone . They had none of the socially sterile attitude towards art which we adopt in our own culture . Instead , they recognised the value of superior workmanship and used its products to honour the gods who were intermediaries between man and the infinite power of the universe . The list of themes and their varied fortunes is a long one . For example , landscape painting had only a gradual success as a theme in European painting . Kenneth Clark demonstrated this development of an evolving sensibility to nature in his lectures , Landscape into Art , published in 1949 . His introduction remarks , incidentally , that : anyone who expects this book to be a treatise on the history of landscape painting will be disappointed ... in spite of copious rewriting , lectures these pages remain . One may remove the words " next slide please " from the text , but not from the sequences of thought . The publication of lectures is a well-known form of literary suicide . I indulge in it now because the audiences who heard them endured , with much patience , extremes of heat and cold . I am grateful , and can only show my gratitude by giving them the text to criticise under more agreeable conditions . A characteristic two pages of the text are given to Corot 's landscapes , five pictures being cited , though the reader is less fortunate than the lecture audience , as only two are illustrated . Here is Clark 's description of Corot 's late style : From all his great range of delicate visual experiences Corot came to be satisfied with one -- shimmery light reflected from water , and passing through the delicate leaves of birches and willows . He concentrated on it because he loved it , and he thereby proved once more his extreme simplicity of character . For he had revealed one of the eternally popular effects of nature , one which is still quoted by simple people as a standard of visual beauty . Animals make up a category of painting with an uneven reputation , though the theme is one of obvious importance and interest in sculpture . Animal Painting in Britain was the title of a book by Basil Taylor , where he explained in his first chapter that the topic had been neglected since it was either assumed to be about sporting pictures , or about pictures of horses by such specialists as Sartorius . He quoted the dismissive comment of the writer of the volume on British Painting 1530-1790 in the Pelican History of Art : " To discuss the Sartorius tribe and such painters is no business of the historian of art , no matter how bitter the accusations of neglect are wont to be from those specialist writers who sometimes confuse the history of art with praising famous horses . " Such a frank exclusion from the domain of art is not a solitary instance . Exclusion , though , is rather less general a problem than a low status for some categories of painting . Academies of art , whether in the West or in the Orient , have had lists of priorities in themes of art , in which there are many similarities . For example , in twelfth-century China , a catalogue of the Imperial collection had ten headings : Taoist and Buddhist subjects , human affairs , palaces and other buildings , foreign tribes , dragons and fishes , landscapes , animals , flowers and birds , ink bamboos , and finally vegetables and fruit . This sort of listing is worth knowing by a reader , who may occasionally notice that it underlies the degree of attention being paid to a theme by a critic . THE SURVEY WITH A THEORY The last type of survey to be considered has a basis in theory . If a critic has a very decided political or religious point of view , this can override other considerations in judgements about art ; the viewpoint may also give a bias to the description or interpretation made . A remarkable Marxist interpretation , for example , was made of Florentine painting from Giotto 's time to the fifteenth century , by Frederick Antal in the 1940s . Later writers , even those sympathetic to Antal 's thesis , have admitted that the argument about class conflict in the period was exaggerated , but this does not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic . Of course , a theorist may damage an argument through bias , perhaps excluding relevant evidence inconvenient to the case being made ; but this is not a danger exclusive to theorists . Omissions are most patent perhaps in surveys made with a political bias . We have already mentioned in passing the state policies regarding the arts in Germany , the USSR and China ; there have been writers who followed the party lines by giving attention to those artists favoured by patronage , while neglecting others . A recent survey with a viewpoint is by the American art historian , Whitney Chadwick . Women , Art and Society is a synthesis of work that has been progressing for twenty years about women and the visual arts . Some women have acquired status as heroines ; Rosalba Carriera , Angelica Kauffmann , Rosa Bonheur , Berthe Morisot , Paula Modersohn-Becker and K�the Kollwitz have found places in a pantheon of major talent from which there ought never to have been any question of their exclusion . But Chadwick makes some sensible points about the questions raised by her account which challenge common assumptions about art and society . Some are connected with writings about literature , philosophy and politics which are called post-modern or post-structural . Post-structuralist texts expose the role of language in deferring meaning and in constructing a subjectivity which is not fixed but is constantly negotiated through a whole range of forces -- economic , social and political . They have undermined long-cherished views of the writer or artist as a unique individual creating in the image of divine creation ( in an unbroken chain that links father and son as in Michelangelo 's God reaching towards Adam in the Sistine Chapel frescoes ) , and the work of art as reducible to a single " true meaning " ... Now artistic intention can be seen more clearly as just one of many often overlapping strands -- ideological , economic , social , political -- that make up the work of art , whether literary text , painting , or sculpture . The most difficult theoretical surveys are those which seem to promise to answer difficult questions about art in general , perhaps especially in the modern world . As in books on the philosophy of art , or aesthetics , many do not in fact contain any art criticism , in the sense of description , interpretation and judgement of individual works . Their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts , and putting new points of view . When works of art are described only those aspects of an image important to the argument are included . It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place , though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics . For example , Chadwick states : " There can be no simple category defined as " feminist art history " , since the effect of new ideas is that " much recent scholarly writing has shifted attention from the categories " art " and " artist " to broader issues concerning ideologies of gender , sexuality , and power " . In short , from some books the reader may gain moral or political enlightenment , but will be disappointed of developing a personal taste . David Talbot Rice describes such development of taste as follows : It is far better to like and admire something that is wrong , or to like and admire for the wrong reason , provided we do so sincerely , than to follow slavishly the dictates or ideas of some other person . If our admiration be true , genuine , and progressive we will in the end come to admire the good and cease to admire the bad . We will learn by our own experience what is best , and not by following the dogmatism of another . But a subtle critic may well save us a great deal of time , pain and trouble in the learning , for he can set us aright at the outset , and by his example rather than by his assertions show us how to avoid admiring that which is unworthy . ZOOMING IN : THE MONOGRAPHS Monographs on Painters Dictionaries describe a monograph as an account of a single subject ; by this definition monographs make up one of the most common categories of art publishing . A book on a single painter , for example , is a monograph . There is some doubt in a grey area of differences between monographs on the one hand , and catalogues or biographies on the other . For convenience , biographies will be included in the present chapter , while catalogues will be treated in the next . There is a boom in publishing books about individual artists , especially those who are already well known . The potential reader of a monograph on a minor artist may not find a book easily , but there are plenty of publications on Leonardo , Rembrandt or Picasso . It might be thought that this was a natural consequence of the popularity of great artists , but in fact the economics of publishing result in some bizarre decisions about art books . The reader with a love of art is not always at the front of a publisher 's attention . Art books are expensive to produce , especially if they contain colour illustrations . One way for a publisher to finance the publication of an art book is to act with other publishers who will share costs ; an alternative is to find a subsidy . Both these strategies affect choices of subjects for art books . Other publishing houses in other countries will naturally prefer artists who are already internationally well known . Subsidies are available from a limited number of sources , such as government agencies , charitable foundations , and , today very rarely , private individuals ; there is a factor of prestige to be counted in this sponsorship , mediated by the decisions of committees . This aside , when the reader has found a monograph , what will it contain ? An older book , that is one published before around 1900 , will only have black and white plates , which are unlikely to be photographs . This applies , for example , to the book on Delacroix published in 1885 , selected by A. Robaut and with an essay by Ernest Chesnau . By the 1920s a characteristic book , as for example C�zanne : a study of his development by Roger Fry , published in 1927 , had black and white photographic illustrations only . In either case , the absence of colour gave an incentive to the authors to provide evocative descriptions . These descriptions were vital to writing about these two artists in whose work colour plays so important a part . At the end of the twentieth century , at least some colour illustrations are likely to find places in a monograph . They may , however , not be exactly what the author would have preferred , as a colour plate which is readily available ( perhaps having been used in another publication ) is much cheaper to use than a new plate which has to be commissioned . The reader can thus be aware that a writer may have written round what happens to have been offered . This may be important in assessing how well a writer illustrates an argument . The standards which can be obtained in colour reproductions today are high , but not always attained . Comparison of illustrations of the same picture in several publications will demonstrate this truism , while the best test of looking at a reproduction in front of the picture itself can be a disheartening experience . A lecture audience looking at a slide projection , incidentally , may also suffer from seeing distorted colours , though art museums take some care to sell transparencies of a satisfactory quality . Considerations of illustrations aside , the reader will be hoping for enlightenment from the text . It is probable that this will have much to offer . Monographs are a main source of considered art critical writing . The author has had time to consider and reflect , so that descriptions , interpretations and evaluations will have been carefully formulated . There are many choices of arrangement and treatment available to a monographer . An art historian may choose to elucidate the social context of the art , or trace its sources in the work of other artists ; these choices will be reflected in the illustrations as well as the text , while sketches , other versions of pictures and related material will be available for the reader to make comparisons . Roger Fry , in writing about C�zanne , took a different route . A painter himself , he was attracted to the problems he believed that C�zanne had faced and solved in composition and technique . Fry 's opening words are : " Those artists among us whose formation took place before the war recognise C�zanne as their tribal deity , and their totem . " Fry thought that in C�zanne 's mature work : The ultimate synthesis of a design was never revealed in a flash ; rather he approached it with infinite precautions , stalking it , as it were , now from one point of view , now from another , and always in fear lest a premature definition might deprive it of something of its total complexity . For him the synthesis was asymptote towards which he was for ever approaching without ever quite reaching it ; it was a reality , incapable of complete realization . An example of Fry 's description of C�zanne 's development dealt with colour : When C�zanne uses colour we note that at each nodal point of the interplay of planes , C�zanne marks this sequence by a series of small washes of various colours , modulating generally from violet to greenish , or bluish grey . His aim in this was as far as possible to translate changes of tones into changes of colour , feeling that only by this method could the full saturation and pressure of colour be realized . I can not doubt that this peculiar method which gave such valuable results in water-colour , influenced C�zanne to apply it at least to the early stages of his oil paintings , and that gradually it grew to be his habitual practice in the succeeding period . In proportion , then , as we advance in the chronological sequence of his works , we find his material become less and less pastose , his touches more and more liquid and transparent , more like watercolour . The change is gradual . Nor is it so regular that we can trust to it altogether to fix the exact date of any given work . There are returns to the impasto , but thin painting certainly predominates towards the end of the century . From description to formal interpretation , we can cite part of an analysis of a portrait , Monsieur Geoffroy : Its success must be partly due to the extraordinary number of sittings to which his admiring and clear-sighted sitter submitted . The construction here is more erudite than in the Madame C�zanne . It is less removed from the ordinary conception of a portrait arrangement . The movements here are more complex , there is a less complete frontality of presentment and symmetry of design . The equilibrium so consummately achieved results from the counterpoise of a great number of directions . One has only to imagine what would happen if the books on the shelf behind the sitter 's head were upright , like the others , to realize on what delicate adjustments the solidity of this amazing structure depends ... He it was who first , among moderns at all events , conceived this method of organizing the infinite complexity of appearance by referring it to a geometrical scaffolding . Though it must be remembered that this is no a priori scheme imposed upon the appearances , but rather an interpretation gradually distilled from them by prolonged contemplation . Whether Fry was justified in his interpretations of C�zanne is not our present question . What is valuable is to see that here is a critic writing at the top of his bent . And Fry was straightforward about his own perceptions . " The critic , I hold , should be loyal enough to his own impressions to confess to what is probably due to his own defects . I must admit therefore that there is one passage in this otherwise consummate design ( A Fruit Dish ) of which the meaning escapes me . I can not see the necessity of the shadow cast by a half-opened drawer in the kitchen table . , It is encouraging to find Fry underlining a point about critical writing -- that with a description of a work of art it can be useful to be given an explicit account of how the critic responds . Another point is also made explicitly . : his difficulty is assessing C�zanne 's work at the end of the century . " It is more difficult to be precise about this than about the earlier phases , partly because the pictures are rarer and less accessible , and have not been adequately photographed , partly because it includes considerable variations . " Fry 's book contains rather little biographical information , the focus being firmly on C�zanne 's work . There is almost nothing about the artist 's contemporaries . This not an invariable pattern for monographs , but readers can usually expect that the central figure of a book will receive prominence at the expense of any other artists . If comparisons are included they may be with an artist whose work is considered by the author to be inferior to the subject of the monograph . Biographical information is another issue . A biography is not a monograph , and , indeed , there are biographies of painters which do little justice to art . In such books the artists " incidental activities receive undue emphasis . the question of what balance can be attained in a book is a familiar problem to literary critics , who are divided in their views into at least two camps , one favouring attention being paid mostly to the text itself , while the other prefers to take other questions into account , including the effect the writer 's life may have on the text . Some see the conflict as having been crystallised by Proust , who wrote an attack on the critic Sainte-Beuve in 1908 ( though it was not published until 1954 ) . Sainte-Beuve , as one of the most widely-read critics of the late nineteenth century , had perfected a conversational essay in which personal anecdotes , quotation , literary judgements and reflections were intermingled . Proust took the view that writers should be judged by their works alone , rather than be interpreted through biography . Ironists reflect with pleasure that nevertheless one of the great literary biographies of the century has subsequently been written about Proust . How valuable biographical information is to literary or art criticism is a question that will never receive a decisive answer ; but a commonplace observation can be made , that circumstances alter cases . Some artists separate their art from their lives , some are articulate about their aims , others are gruffly evasive . C�zanne was not forthcoming in his letters or his conversation . His dealer Ambroise Vollard wrote a book of reminiscences about the painter , including a famous passage about his portrait . " After a hundred and fifteen sittings , C�zanne abandoned my portrait to return to Aix . " The front of the shirt is not bad " -- such were his last words on parting . " The personal characters of artists can not be infallibly deduced from their work . " Art is a rum business " , thought Turner , and the attentive reader of a book about artists called Born under Saturn can not avoid thinking that artists are unpredictable while reading through its sections on misers , criminals , celibates , debauchees , suicides , melancholics and eccentrics . The authors are Rudolph and Margot Wittkower , and their theme is that while some artists succeed in financial and social circumstances without strain , other artists tend to Saturnine temperaments . " Saturn is the planet of melancholics , and Renaissance philosophers discovered that the emancipated artists of their time should have the characteristics of the Saturnine temperament ; they were contemplative , meditating , brooding , solitary , creative . " Comparable ideas about artists can be discovered in other cultures , but also very different views . Even in Europe , Saturn is not the only planet under whose influence it is possible to be born . " Mercury is the patron of cheerful , lively men of action . According to ancient tradition , craftsmen , among others , are born under his sign . " Beyond which , a disbeliever in astrology can find quite other ways of categorising artists . A final caution about using monographs about painters is that they can seldom be read alone . Historical background is only compressed in a monograph ; biographical material may be more extensive in other sources ; the painter 's contemporaries will not receive much attention , and may be slighted . Even illustrations may not be adequate , details of pictures often being poorly represented , leaving an artist 's techniques , materials and handling to be discovered from more specialist studies . The reader can hope , all the same , that the writer will give an account of the special merits of key pictures , and it is these art critical passages which can be of most help in enjoying or appreciating the chosen artist 's achievement . BIOGRAPHIES A biography of an artist is a tricky proposition for a writer , since the artist may prefer to be judged through art , not life ; the incidentals of an everyday activity , not altogether under the artist 's control , are rather unimportant compared to the artist 's concentrated effort to create paintings or sculpture . The biographer may come up against problems of concealment , both written records and works having been destroyed . Early work is often missing from an artist 's oeuvre , while student work or juvenilia may be saved only by chance or possibly by a devoted family . Lionello Venturi considered lives of artists made up a basic category of art criticism , buttressing his opinion with accounts of writings by Vasari and others . However , if biographies of artists are carefully examined , it will be found that they do not necessarily contain much art criticism at all ; a biographer may prefer not to express personal views about the artist 's work ; a book 's main thrust may be to describe the artist 's own aims and ideas . This will result in the book evading the task of art criticism altogether , though the critical views of the artist may be recorded . A deferential biographer is especially likely to take this line . An exception may be illustrated by a passage from a classic biography , that of John Constable by Charles Leslie . Leslie was himself a painter , and thus comments in his own right on his friend 's art , as here on a painting of Hampstead Heath : I have before noticed that what are commonly called warm colours are not necessary to produce the impression of warmth in landscape ; and this picture affords , to me , the strongest possible proof of the truth of this . The sky is of the blue of an English summer day , with large , but not threatening , clouds of a silvery whiteness . The distance is of a deep blue , and the near trees and grass of the freshest green ; for Constable could never consent to parch up the verdure of nature to obtain warmth . These tints are balanced by a very little warm colour on a road and gravel pit in the foreground , a single house in the middle distance , and the scarlet jacket of a labourer . Yet I know of no picture in which the mid-day heat of Midsummer is so admirably expressed ; and were not the eye refreshed by the shade thrown over a great part of the foreground by some young trees , that border the road , and the cool blue of water near it , one would wish , in looking at it , for a parasol , as Fuseli wished for an umbrella when standing before one of Constable 's showers . Such a passage is exceptional in Leslie 's book , which , in the Victorian manner , was a memoir with extensive quotations from Constable 's letters . Constable 's own personality and opinions are thus the main gain of a reader from Leslie 's book . To borrow a phrase from a biography of Van Gogh , the writer had had the advantage of having the artist as a coauthor . This phrase comes from Carl Nordenfalk 's book , The Life and Work of Van Gogh , first published in 1943 ( in English in 1953 ) . Nordenfalk starts his preface as follows . Van Gogh 's life has so often been made the subject of literary treatment that the art historian is strongly inclined to leave the biographical matter severely alone and concentrate exclusively on the artistic aspect . But he is soon forced to the conclusion that in this case it is impossible to keep the aesthetic side entirely apart from the biographical . The reason is that with Van Gogh art and life are not merely conditioned by each other to a greater degree than with any other artist , but actually merge with each other . In a sense , Van Gogh 's life is itself an artistic creation . Van Gogh as the subject for a biographer is thus a test case . Nordenfalk 's book includes the scrupulous examination of visual evidence always welcome and often found in writing by a museum curator . Here he describes the impact of Impressionism on Van Gogh 's work in the spring of 1887 : He had resolutely abandoned his old palette and the method of mixing complementary colours to dirty intermediate tones of grey . Instead , he put a rich range of clear rainbow colours on his palette , replacing the dirty ochre colours with light and more luminous chromium colours , with the addition of Veronese green , ultramarine and lacquer colours , and following the Impressionist recipe in not mixing these colours with anything except white or closely allied colours . Interpretation of the artist 's work , however , depends on the artist 's own account , since Nordenfalk had " the deliberate intention of presenting Van Gogh the writer and thinker " . The sober intentions of his book were very different from the novels , plays and films which have created a mythical figure in modern culture of the artist as isolated and neglected , recognised only after his death , and whom the phrase " genius and madness are near aligned " seems to fit . The novel Lust for Life by Irving Stone , published in 1934 , is the most famous of these productions , popularising a vein of interpretation established early in the century by some of Van Gogh 's first advocates , such as the taste-maker Julius Meier-Graefe , who defended Van Gogh in 1906 , and went on to write a book in his praise in 1921 called Vincent . But this was a drama , the story of the circumstances of Van Gogh 's life ; " No attempt has been made , " wrote Meier-Graefe , " to make a critical analysis of the pictures , which enter upon the scene only in so far as they concern the drama directly or indirectly . " ARTISTS " OWN WRITING Van Gogh is famous not only for his art , but for his writing . He did not write an autobiography , but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide audience , especially artists . Luckily , he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ; the letters are thus an invaluable source of interpretation . From the distance of a century , some of Van Gogh 's enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ; but then , this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose , or work from which he was able to draw inspiration . Private letters are like a conversation overheard , often more revealing than an autobiography , or than a diary which may have been written with more than half an intention of allowing it to be published . What private letters from an artist can do best is to elucidate what was uppermost in an artist 's mind at the time , often artistic aims which would be difficult to discover otherwise . Besides which , there are some artists whom it is a pleasure to know even a little better from their letters . Many readers must have sighed with regret that so few of Gainsborough 's letters have survived , since the charm of his style is so fresh ; it is easy to sympathise with him writing about his professional commitment to portraiture , on behalf of two fine ladies , his daughters : I 'm sick of Portraits and wish very much to take my viol-da-gamba and walk off to some sweet village , where I can paint landskips and enjoy the fag-end of life in quietness and ease . But these fine ladies and their tea-drinkings , husband-huntings , etc. , etc. , etc. , will job me out of the last ten years , and I fear miss getting husbands too . But we can say nothing to these things you know Jackson , we must jog on and be content with the jingling of the bells , only d -- it , I hate a dust , and kicking up a dust , and being confined in harness while others ride in the waggon , under cover , stretching their legs in the straw at ease , and gazing at green trees and blue skies without half my Taste . Artists on their travels sometimes write letters which are good value , whether in praise or censure of what they see . Lawrence , for example , was in Parma in 1820 , in ecstasy over the work of Correggio : Four times I went on long visits to the St Jerome , his finest work . How beautiful , how devoid of everything like the handicraft of art it is -- the largeness , and yet ingenuity of its effect -- the purity of its colour -- the truth , yet refinement and elegance of the action , particularly of the hands ( in which he particularly excels ) ; and then , a lesson to all high-minded slovens , the patient vigilance with which the whole is linked together , by touches , in some instances small almost as a miniature , but like the sparkling of water . Diaries are perhaps more often a vehicle for complaints . Here is an American artist writing about his dismay at the work he saw at Paris in 1831 : Although I had been informed that the present French artists were low in merit , I did not expect to find them , with little exception , so totally devoid of it . I was disgusted in the beginning with their subjects . Battle , Murder , and Death , Venuses and Psyches , the bloody and voluptuous , are the things in which they seem to delight : and these are portrayed in a cold , hard , and often tawdry style , with an almost universal deficiency of chiaroscuro ; the whole artificial , labored and theatrical . Thomas Cole was not a diarist on the scale or with the range of one of the French painters , surely respected even by him , Eug�ne Delacroix . Delacroix 's journal is articulate , concerned with other arts as well as painting , besides containing much comment on contemporary life . A passage of analogies in painting and poetry comes from September 1847 . " I see in painters prose writers and poets . Rhyme , measure , and the turning of verses , which is indispensable and which gives them so much vigor , are analogous to the hidden symmetry , to the equilibrium at once wise and inspired , which governs the meeting or separation of lines and spaces , the echoes of color , etc. " poetic painting was Delacroix 's preference , but " David 's picture of Leonidas at Thermopolae is masculine and vigorous prose , I admit " . In another passage in 1853 , this time about The Bathers , a painting by Courbet , he invokes the aesthetic standards of music . He did not like Courbet 's subject . " The commonness and the uselessness of the thought are abominable ; and if only his idea , common and useless as it is , were clear ... Oh , Rossini ! Oh , Mozart ! Oh , geniuses inspired in all the arts , who draw from things only such elements of them as are to be shown to the mind ! What would you say before these pictures ! " Artists ' writing on art can naturally be more practical or technical , even in defining their own aims . The virtue of artists ' writings for the reader of criticism is that it can often serve as a touchstone for judging the worth of mediators , particularly those presenting views of what the artist intended ; what the artist said may be more to the point . SCULPTURAL MONOGRAPHS Books about sculpture have problems all of their own . The first and most obvious difficulty is that a three-dimensional object can not fit satisfactorily on to a flat page . Different views of a sculpture can be presented , but you can not move round a sculpture except with a film camera . There is also the problem of settings . Some sculptures are designed for their sites , and the relationship between site and sculpture is difficult to capture in a book . Sculpture parks are an enjoyable innovation of the late twentieth century , or perhaps it would be better to say a welcome adaptation of an existing practice . In the seventeenth century Louis XIV had a sculpture park at Versailles , but it surrounded his palace , and was more formally designed by Le N�tre , who needed sculptures for the focal points of his avenues . Twentieth-century sculpture parks are less rigidly planned , and intended to accommodate sculpture by artists in many different styles . The site can be adapted to suit the sculpture , which has a dominant role , unlike sculpture destined for the decoration of palatial gardens . Commemorative figures in city squares , portrait busts , tomb or cemetery furniture have also been traditionally restricted by the terms of commissions . A consequence of this tradition is that the sculptor 's own personality may receive less prominence in a monograph than a painter 's , as the effect of patronage given or withheld can be decisive in a sculptor 's career . The other major role of the sculptor is in the service of religion , where a high degree of interplay between artist and patron is not necessarily so important , making the sculptor 's situation into one which is more like the painter 's . Writing on Auguste Rodin can make the point . According to George Heard Hamilton , Rodin became " a figure of international significance , the most admired , prolific , and influential sculptor since Bernini " . His secretary , the poet Rainer Maria Rilke , wrote with feeling about his work , but during the 1920s Rodin was less regarded , and not until after the Second World War did his reputation revive under the stimulus of exhibitions and increasingly careful cataloguing of his work . A decline of the sculptor 's reputation derived not only from the political discredit into which the regimes of the years before 1914 had fallen , but also from a distaste for allegory , and a revulsion from naturalist sculpture ( which the young Brancusi expressed forcefully as a dislike for " beefsteak " ) . With the rise of modernism , Rodin 's reputation fell ; with the decline of modernism , Rodin 's fame is growing again . Rodin was a skilful salesman of his work , making careful use of photography in establishing and maintaining his good name . After 1900 , he insisted that no photography of his work was allowed without his permission . There was a healthy demand for prints and postcards , which added to his income from the arrangements he had with photographers and agencies . As Albert Elsen has noted : We know that with major sculptures such as The Burghers of Calais and the Balzac , Rodin did not claim that they were equally successful from all points of view . He believed that these monuments succeeded compositionally from five or six angles . Given Rodin 's collaboration with his photographers , these old photographs go far in answering the question from which points of view and from what distances they should be seen . What was true of Rodin 's sculpture is also worth consideration by any reader of a sculptural monograph . Another aspect of the matter is the question of scale . Reproduced to a uniform size on the printed page , sculptures which are monumental in size can not be distinguished from those which are mere studies or maquettes . There is the possibility of misinterpretation by the reader . Some compensation may exist in sketches and preliminary drawings , where they exist , and which are easier to study on a page . These may take either the form of related drawings , or in Rodin 's case , a free style of drawing which demonstrates his power of vivid creative improvisation with the human figure . A further issue is how well sculptures are suited to their sites . Sculptural monographs often contain little information on this topic , and photographs of sculptures in situ are missing . Further , public response to works in prominent positions is rarely commented on . Yet for a work in a public square this is an interesting aspect of art criticism . Perhaps in the last decade of this century something of a change in attitude to sculpture is becoming evident . The spaces in a city are more valued , and their enhancing is more a matter of public concern . Sculptures in cities are a part of cultural history , and can be the symbols by which the cities are known or remembered . Rome is distinguished by the statue on the Capitoline Hill of Marcus Aurelius ; New York , even the United States , is symbolised by the Statue of Liberty ; Copenhagen is remembered for its mermaid . Also , the history of sculpture includes some account of the abortive plans for sculpture , just as the history of architecture is incomplete as a history of ideas without a knowledge of rejected proposals . Even though the same might be argued for painting , the technical obstacles to be overcome for painting are very much less than for sculpture . Again , this is where sculpture is closely aligned to social and political history . MONOGRAPHS ON INDIVIDUAL WORKS An art monograph need not be about a person , but can be about an individual work or a scheme such as a mural decoration . This is a fine opportunity for a sustained piece of writing , calling on a range of historical and artistic data , and including the art critical views not only of the author , but also criticism written at other periods . A recent monograph of Jacob Epstein 's memorial sculpture to the naturalist W. H. Hudson at Hyde Park Corner may be used as an example . Terry Friedman 's book contains fourteen chapters , which chart the development of the work and its public reception -- a stormy one . The topics include the first design , the sculptor 's aims , the carving of the work , the memorial 's defenders and attackers , and a final general reflection on the standing of great art and how it is likely to provoke opposition . The monograph is accompanied by a facsimile of a sketchbook for the memorial , and documented by letters and printed sources , including articles in the press . the art criticism of the day is fully described in the monograph , and some of the underlying reasons for its mainly aggressive character are outlined ; these include anti-Semitism and the fierce dislike of the monument by some academic sculptors . A guide to London public sculpture described the monument as " A masterpiece by the much-advertised apostle of Ugliness " , a view shared by those who felt that Hudson the nature lover was ill commemorated by a sculpture which showed nature in so raw a state . Comparisons of the sculpture with other contemporary works are included , and a summary conclusion implies the eventual security of the controversial sculpture in its Hyde Park home . The Hudson memorial is not widely known , but the scope of this monograph is exemplary . Similar treatment can be found in works on great monuments and schemes , perhaps especially in the Italian Renaissance , when such projects as the Sistine Chapel or Tintoretto 's Scuola di San Rocco achieved a personal artistic unity of the highest standard . for art historians , incomplete schemes or dismembered works such as altarpieces have the attraction of needing detective work ; but a critic takes an interest in a reconstruction only if it throws new light on surviving art . The main strength of this sort of monograph is its potential for detailed interpretation . As a book on a single subject , there is a good chance that the need for description will be reduced by extensive illustration , while a favourable judgement on the work has already been implied by the choice of the subject for a monograph . The interpretation of imagery , the circumstances of production , the place of the work in the artist 's career , the historical context , the precise information about the work 's appearance and condition , these are things that can be fully discussed in a monograph . VERSATILE ARTISTS A monograph on an artist who practises in several fields can be unusually interesting , since the writer 's brief is to write with equal competence on different topics . Occasionally the challenge is too daunting , and teams of writers combine forces rather than one author attempting to rival the knowledge and skills of a Leonardo . More frequently work in different media is split up into specialist studies , so that although there are general studies of Gauguin 's work , there are also specialist monographs on his prints , and on his sculpture and ceramics . The versatile artist raises the question of relationship between the arts , and how far they can be considered to have the same or similar aims . In the nineteenth century it was Richard Wagner whose extraordinary ambition it was to make a complete artistic environment , in which the arts would blend . Historians can point to the philosophical views which underlay this ambition , and artists and sculptors were in various ways affected by the demonstration of its realisation in the theatre built for the composer at Bayreuth . The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev , in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet . This connection between painting and the theatre was important to earlier European art in religious as well as secular performances . Critics no less than artists have wide interests in the arts , and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations . In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise . In the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent , emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology , as when Kandinsky chose to call his works Improvisations and Compositions . According to this formalist approach art aspires to the condition of music , a phrase employed by Pater , but deriving from classical Greece . Clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references . The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used . In the late twentieth century artists working in performance pose difficulties for the critic , though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture . In sum , then , the monograph is a major site for art critical writing , and , moreover , the place where the most extended criticism is likely to appear . The reader may be disappointed by the standard of what is written , but unlike other sites of criticism , this can not be attributed to the form of publication , only to the limitations of the author . In a monograph , the author has the best chance of a free hand . PANNING ANGLES : THE CATALOGUES CATALOGUES RAISONN�S The second half of the nineteenth century saw new standards achieved in art historical scholarship , both through the careful study of documents and by close scrutiny of works of art . The results of these studies were published extensively in catalogues of private and public collections , and in what in French are termed catalogues raisonn�s , that is to say complete lists of artists ' works . Such catalogues were important to scholarship and also to the art market . If a scholar authenticated a work as by a major artist , then its price was certain to be higher . A hero of this period was Giovanni Morelli , a remarkable Italian connoisseur who started publishing essays on pictures in public collections in 1874 . His decisive opinions about the correct attributions of authorship in pictures were founded on a personal method , partly inspired by his medical training . He paid close attention to characteristics in a painting so apparently insignificant as the shape of a nostril or the lobe of an ear , arguing that such details were too unimportant for a follower to copy exactly . For example , Morelli wrote : " In all those works by Raphael in which the execution is entirely his own , the ear , like the hand , is always characteristic , and differs in form from the ears of Timoteo Viti , Perugino , Pinturicchio , and others . " Typically , Morelli participated in one of the Swiss glacial expeditions organised by Louis Agassiz . Agassiz later became the foremost zoological teacher in the United States , basing his teaching practice on the observation of nature . Agassiz discouraged the use of books , except for research work . One story about his teaching is that a new student would be told to observe a fish in a tank . After some time the student would return to report . " Look again , " he would be told . After a week , Agassiz 's object lesson in respect for examining nature had made its impact . Morelli 's insistence on observation was a comparable approach to learning . Morelli 's method was extended by other scholars , and joined to systematic examination of documents . One of Morelli 's youthful students was Bernard Berenson , whom Morelli described in 1890 as " an extraordinarily scholarly young man who had already advanced far in the study of art " . The young Berenson was a polymath , whose brilliant career at Harvard led his friends to pay for him to visit Europe to continue his studies . It was in Berlin that he first read Morelli 's work . Four years after their meeting he published an account of Venetian painters of the Renaissance , where he acknowledged " his indebtedness to the first systematic writers on Italian painting no less than to the perfectors of the new critical method , now adopted by nearly all serious students of Italian art " . Berenson had found his vocation : " to be sure that every Lotto is a Lotto , every Cariani a Cariani , every Santecroce a Santacroce " . His book on Lorenzo Lotto , published in 1895 , was subtitled " An Essay in Constructive Art Criticism " . He spent the rest of his life in expertise , painstakingly cataloguing the pictures and drawings of his favoured period , the Italian Renaissance , and in giving advice , notably to the great Bostonian collector , Mrs Gardner , and the main dealer of the period , Joseph Duveen . Berenson 's decisions on attributions are listed in a reference catalogue , The Italian Paintings of the Renaissance . The Morellian method had opponents , among them some of the German scholars of whom Morelli made fun by his articles . His judgements were impressive nevertheless , so that some critics were reduced to agreeing with his conclusions while denying the validity of his system . Before his day , and after it , there were scholars who relied more on intuition . Max Friedlander , an outstanding scholar of Northern European art , took the view that accepting a work into an artist 's oeuvre was like recognising a friend , not a matter of measurement or detailed scrutiny . The reader is thus relying on Friedlander 's eye . A difference between Morelli and Friedlander is that the former explains his method , while the latter does not . More than a hundred years have passed since Morelli started writing ; in that time many problems of authorship have been solved , while about others tacit agreement has been reached . The results of this process can be read in detail in catalogues raisonn�s , which often give a blow-by-blow account of the arguments of scholars over the years . Here is a summary account of Manet 's favourite painting by Tintoretto , the self-portrait in the Louvre . It comes from a book on Tintoretto by Hans Tietze ( the references are left out ) . On the engraving of the picture made by Gisbert van Geen in 1588 , for which Pozzoferrato supplied the ornamental framework and which Ridolfi reproduced in his biography , Tintoretto is described as being seventy years old . According to this the picture must have been painted about 1588 , with which the style and the age of the sitter agree . From a letter to Francesco Gonzaga , written in 1622 and published by A. Luzio , in which among others a self-portrait of Tintoretto is offered to him , Pittalunga argues that the Paris picture may have been the one mentioned and which formed part of Rubens 's estate . This sort of reading is only for the dedicated follower of the history of taste , though any reader particularly interested in a picture may find within a single catalogue entry an acutely discriminating judgement or interesting facts ; for example , Tietze 's entry also points out that Manet so much admired the Tintoretto self-portrait that he made a copy of it . The catalogue raisonn� continues to be a key document for authentication of an artist 's work . As the decades have gone by , scholarly work has piled up , so that this category of book has taken a larger , longer and much more expensive form than before . Today catalogues raisonn�s are often divided into two ; one volume is for an introduction and plates , while the other has the detailed catalogue . Disputes over authorship are fiercely fought , and in the nature of things , frequently impossible to resolve with finality . However , the reputation of the cataloguer may be in some instances considered decisive ; the picture is by Van Gogh if it is in the book by de la faille ; a painting by Berthe Morisot needs to be approved by Bataille and Wildenstein ; an authentic work by Picasso will be found in Zervos . Problems of authenticity are not so great or modern art as for other periods , even if a gifted forger like the painter Elmir de Horty can fool some of the people for some of the time . Catalogues raisonn�s of modern artists do not depend on scholarly guesswork at attributions , and thus lack the laconic critical judgements reached by connoisseurs . In compensation , pictures or sculptures may be accompanied by comments from the artists . Additionally , the cataloguer will be sure to make comparisons , which will be useful to the reader , for the format is one of the few in which a generous number of illustrations can be included . Any compiler of a catalogue raisonn� will have seen and compared all the works listed , or will scruple to state if some work has proved inaccessible . At this level of personal and intimate experience there is little competition from other observers ; only a handful of people in the world will ever see all the works in a catalogue raisonn� . The scholar who completes such a work thus has an edge on other writers , so a preface can be read with the respect due to a first-hand account of the works concerned and a considered piece of reflective criticism . EXHIBITION CATALOGUES Exhibitions are major arenas for spectators of art , as well as for artists ' struggles to achieve reputations and recognition . This section will consider not what the critics write in reviews of exhibitions , but the criticism which is contained within the exhibition catalogues ; not the commentary from the box , but the programme of events . A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made . There are shows which could be grouped under the heading of historical exhibitions ; there are mixed exhibitions and group exhibitions of works by living artists ; and there are exhibitions in dealers ' galleries , notably solo shows . The catalogues which accompany these events have rather different characters , for although there are entries for the exhibited works in each sort of catalogue , and usually an introduction , historical catalogues often have additional essays . Catalogues of major shows have also become bigger and more expensive in recent years , usually through the help of national , industrial or commercial sponsorship . A characteristic historical exhibition may be called something like " The Age of Rembrandt " , or " Shock of Recognition ; the landscape of English Romanticism and the Dutch seventeenth-century school " ; both of these are actual titles . Such catalogues include accounts of relevant historical research , and may cause new original historical work to be done . Individual works may be studied more carefully for a catalogue entry than ever before . In several ways , then , a catalogue may be in advance of any other publications . The corollary is that some catalogue information has only a limited life , since it may in its turn be overtaken by new research . In the introduction or other essays there may be some writing which will not date , such as art criticism which documents the personal experience of the writer . Take , for example , this record of a personal response to Picasso 's sculpture The Man with a Sheep by the critic Tim Hilton in the catalogue for " Picasso 's Picassos , in 1981 : The Man with a Sheep is said to be humanitarian ; that is far from one 's experience in front of it , and the assertion is not much supported by the iconographical evidence . Is this a king who is the shepherd of his people ? Or a priest of some unknown religion who strides towards us , implacably set on some atavistic rite ? In the drawings the lamb appears to have bound feet , and the purport of the piece is surely more to do with sacrifice than deliverance . Some art criticism in a catalogue may be included so as to document the history of taste . For example , in " The Shock of Recognition " John Constable 's love for the work of van Ruisdael is highlit . Another entry , for The Ancient Oak by Jan van Goyen ( painted in 1642 ) seeks to explain a later English attitude to a seventeenth-century work : The ancient , weathered oak is the main motif , a theme as much used and loved by the Romantic poets and painters as the old willow tree . The execution , however , and this is typical of the 17th century Dutch masters , is more minute ; and the composition , completely determined by a diagonal , is stricter than that of the English painters . According to 18th century principles the painting is " sublime " in the roughness and irregularity of the tree , as well as " beautiful " in the smoothness of the water . An instructive and recent example of a historical exhibition is " Making Their Mark " , toured in the United States during 1989 . The subtitle of the show was " Women artists move into the mainstream , 1970 -- 1985 " . The catalogue is 300 pages long with eight essays , as well as artists ' biographies . In this instance the individual exhibited items are unnumbered and put in a check list ; the main critical writing is within 136 pages , written in ten sections by Judith E. Stein ( six sections ) and Ann-Sargent Wooster ( four sections on video ) . Such a catalogue inevitably tends to describe and characterise artists rather than evaluate them , while interpretation is likely to be left to quotations from the artists . Here is a passage about a picture by Judy Rifka : " In Square Dress , a dancer , seen from above , is set off against an exuberant field of abstract color patches and architecturally evocative lines and circles . Segments of the athletic composition push forward into the viewer 's space because Rifka has affixed additional forms onto the surface plane . " Elsewhere , Thomas McEvilley writes : " One day in 1970 fifty thousand women marched down fifth Avenue in New York . It is said to have been the biggest women 's gathering since suffrage days , a little more than half a century before ... H. W. Janson 's History of Art , the standard college textbook , did not at that time mention a single woman artist " ; and in discussing the period reviewed by the exhibition , various choices of media made by women artists are chronicled , for , " Many women artists eschewed painting -- especially abstract painting -- as a domain polluted by long saturation with male dominant values , and developed their themes in performance . " On the central issue raised by the subtitle of the show , art in or out of the mainstream , some statistical study was made of the representation of women artists and the milestones in their careers . The catalogue as a whole is thus a document in the history of taste , a historical account , and at the same time contains some art criticism , not always explicit in evaluating the works shown . " Making Their Mark " could equally well have been called a mixed exhibition ; but this is a term more often used for a show put on by an exhibiting society , that type of artists ' organisation whose importance in Europe was created by the middle classes , who sought in the eighteenth century to buy pictures rather than give commissions , as aristocratic patrons had been accustomed to do . Mixed exhibitions tend to have rather perfunctory introductions and catalogue entries ; the same is often true of exhibitions arranged by groups of artists , though they may have statements of aim or even an artists ' manifesto . Generally , art criticism connected with mixed and group exhibitions is commentary from outside , so that we shall return to them , with only this brief mention here , in the next chapter . We can consider solo exhibitions instead , in either public or commercial galleries . Major art museums may devote considerable resources to an individual artist 's exhibition , on the same scale as a historical show . But one feature of a catalogue of an exhibition for a living artist which is different is the likely inclusion of reminiscences from colleagues and members of the artist 's family , who may make enlightening comments . A dealer will have chosen his critic with special care for an introduction , an ideal candidate often being a sympathetic friend , perhaps a curator . In 1904 Sidney Colvin was Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum . Colvin had known Burne-Jones , and was persuaded to write a preface for a London gallery show . His text preserves a careful balance between deference , quotation and his own selective critical comment : The nature of Burne-Jones 's aims and predilections in art are well-enough known by this time , and have been defined by himself absolutely fitted to this thought : " I mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream of something that never was , never will be -- in a light better than any light that ever shone -- in a land no one can define or remember , only desire . " If any one element in his style is to be singled out as predominant , it is that haunting expression of far-away desire never absent from the eyes and lips , and conveyed in every gesture , feature and attitude . Giacometti was an artist with very different artistic aims , clearly expounded by Valerie J. Fletcher in a catalogue for an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , Washington , in 1988 . Writing about a small bust on a column , a thin sculpture in a series of four busts of which the others were fuller in form , she comments that " the extremely thin proportions of the head contrast with the solidity of the base . So delicately modulated are the forms of the head that the human element appears ephemeral . This tenuous fragility contrasts with the three later busts on a stele , which have substantial anatomical forms . " The sculptor had decided that he wanted this bust to confront the observer . " In these sculptures I tried to make an eye . I raised the head on a base until the eye is at eye level . You see an eye . " This intention differed from the sculptor 's frequent artistic aim to make his small figures appear remote . The catalogue has the additional interest of a memoir by Silvio Berthoud , who had sat as a boy between five and eight for his uncle : I have very unpleasant recollections of sitting for him , for it was of utmost importance not to move but to fix him right in the eye and listen to him complain , saying as he always did that he was getting nowhere . It was not much fun , particularly at my age ... Things would deteriorate rather quickly , for Alberto would return to his hotel in the evening with a sculpture eight to twelve inches tall under his arm and come back the next day with a piece no more than three or four inches high ... I later realized that I had posed during a crucial period , and the tiny bronzes that resulted ( for that size prevailed ) continue daily to touch me . Another example from the 1980s allows us to hear a conversation between the critic Norbert Lynton and the painter Ken Kiff . Kiff set out to make an image of a man writing . Mayakovsky 's poem " An Amazing Adventure of Vladimir Mayakovsky " surfaced as he worked . It celebrates creativity amid doubt and despondency -- creativity as energy but also as a duty , work to be done by man as it is the sun 's task to shine . I have pointed out to him that his picture echoes the medieval and Renaissance formula for St John on Patmos writing the Book of Revelation and for the evangelists writing the Gospels , itself derived from Greco-Roman author portraits . This was not his intention but iconographical echoes of this sort do not surprise him . The writer goes on to make further points about the picture 's elements . These examples of catalogues containing helpful art criticism could be contrasted with many others which are limited to lists of exhibitions , details of the artist 's career , and entries for the works displayed . There are other hazards for the readers of catalogues . Some publications are less impartial than they might appear , erring on the side of generosity . Museums with exhibitions of art from other countries are especially likely to be respectful in commentaries on works of art which have been borrowed . All the same , museum curators will have carried out a critical task in selecting the exhibition , in some instances having fended off proposals for inclusions with a political or a particular cultural bias . In a commercial gallery , the size of the rooms is decisive . It might make artistic sense for the gallery to borrow some key picture to enhance the look of an exhibition , but a picture which is not for sale is an expensive use of wall space . Finally it is safe to predict that in any catalogue there will be more information than art criticism . AUCTION CATALOGUES Buying and selling art is at its most dramatic in an auction , a fact that auction houses are quick to exploit . In the last three decades there has been considerable success for auctioneering , both in terms of money and also in prestige . The idea that a price at auction is a definitive market price has even become quite generally accepted , although in fact auctions are subject to manipulation like other markets described by some economists as free . An undeniable attraction of an auction is the possibility that some undervalued item may be for sale . The auction houses employ considerable skill to ensure that the best possible prices are obtained for their clients , but all the same , a good eye and a well-stocked memory may still outwit their expertise . An occasional exploit deservedly catches the newspaper headlines , like the case of a picture spotted by a London dealer , David Carritt . Sothebys were unfortunate enough to misattribute a French eighteenth-century picture , which was in fact by Fragonard . Carritt bought it , correctly identified it as a lost early work , and magnanimously sold it to the National Gallery , London , far below the market price . Auction catalogues do not carry critical comments on individual items for sale , but there are sometimes introductions with criticism . An example is the catalogue of paintings by No�l Coward , which was prefaced by a memoir of the playwright , describing his interest in painting . In marketing a sale of rather little-known works , too , there may be some explanatory text . It would be wrong to dismiss this sort of criticism as mere sales talk , particularly in grand auctioneers ' catalogues , though there is little danger of such publications being reticent . Part of the charm of a sale is that the financial result is in itself a sort of critical judgement , reflecting even if not defining the taste and mood of the moment . But an auction is mainly a bullish market ; vendors are trying to improve their prices , and few except dealers are selling on the market 's way down , in order to rebuy . This bearish tactic does not work as well as in a stock market , for art works are widely dispersed , and decisions to buy or sell may be thoroughly unpredictable . One view of the art market is that it is like a staircase with several landings . Only dealers sell on the steps , while private owners prefer the more certain floor of a landing of clearly established prices for a category of work . Correct descriptions are important to auctioneers , as can be exemplified by the coding used to list paintings . This is the system used by Sothebys : ( a ) references to signatures , inscription and dates refer to the present state of the work ; ( b ) the term " bears a signature " and/ or " date " and/ or " inscription " means that in our opinion the artist 's name and/ or " date " and/ or inscription have been added by another hand ; ( c ) the term " signed " and/ or " dated " and/ or " inscribed " means that in our opinion the signature and/ or date and/ or inscription are from the hand of the artist . Such caution is prudent in a business where errors of judgement can be extremely expensive ; at least the reader of an auction catalogue knows clearly what view has been taken by the cataloguer on a number of questions . The auction catalogue can also quote from other authorities , which will be inevitable in a case where a scholar has written a catalogue raisonn� , and advantageous if the context of the work is made clearer by the artist 's correspondence or other publications . Long catalogue entries recall the cynical remark that the price of a painting is in ratio to the length of the bibliography in the sale catalogue . Besides seeking to establish the authenticity of works in the sale room , auctioneers are also concerned that the title to ownership is secure . The indirect evidence of critical approval by a succession of owners may be interesting to a reader , though admittedly this demands some special knowledge about the standing of the collectors concerned . Luckily for the curious , this historical sideline can be followed up in a number of publications , both about individuals and institutions . The authentication of works of art from other parts of the world can be problematic . For African art , say , the difficulties are complicated by lack of written or other corroboration , and knowledge that extensive copying has been done . Thefts of art works are also an international problem , especially poignant in the case of objects with cultural and religious significance . Occasionally auctions contain items so interesting that critics in newspapers comment on their quality , not just the prices they might fetch . More often auctions are not reviewed ; this is a pity , since the management of markets in art deserves scrutiny . The visitor to an auction may be caught up in the excitement and drama of the event , but the climate of opinion in which it takes place has been created by scholars and critics as well as businessmen . MUSEUM CATALOGUES Casual visitors to art museums generally prefer short guides to the official catalogues . Some guides are indeed very brief , suggesting visits at breakneck speed where only a few items or rooms will be seen . Is it Tuesday between eleven o'clock and noon ? This must be the Albertina . A museum catalogue is an imposing task for a curator , so daunting indeed that some museums never publish one . Difficulties can be many , at the top of the list being the number of items to be catalogued . Happy indeed is the curator of a select collection like the Mauritzhuis in The Hague , where one collector 's policy was to limit his collection to thirty excellent works , lesser works being discarded to make way for better . The curator 's nightmare is somewhere like the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , where the number of items is like grains of sand on the sea shore . A model for art museums is the catalogue of the National Gallery , London . Divided into national schools , in separate publications , the gallery also publishes short guides , souvenir guides , books of details , a complete photographic record of the pictures , specialist publications on conservation , and educational material . The keystone of the arch of publications must be the catalogue itself , from which the authority of other writing derives . The catalogue of the earlier Italian schools was written by Martin Davies , and published in 1951. the strength of the gallery 's holding of works by Giovanni Bellini made it worth the author 's while to write a preliminary note about difficulties of attribution : A definition of Bellini 's oeuvre is one of the hardest problems in the history of painting . The first difficulty is , despite the destructions , the enormous number of existing pictures , many of them signed , and in one way or another more or less Bellinesque . It is obvious that Bellini had assistants to help him in his studio ; indeed , there is documentary proof of that . But the question of what pictures are entirely or for practical purposes Bellini 's own is answered largely by personal taste ; there is therefore a considerable divergence of view . The catalogue of the German school was published in 1959 , and written by Michael Levey . The entry for number 291 , a portrait of a woman , is a fair example of method : " The quality of ( the picture ) seems sufficiently high for it to be acceptable as from Cranach 's own hand . It is associated by Friedlander and Rosenberg with a group of similar female portraits , and shows clear analogies of handling . " The connoisseurship demonstrated in these two examples is built up from an accumulation of work by many scholars , but in the end , the cataloguer has to make a judgement , which for number 291 is in favour of Cranach 's authorship . Sometimes subjects require considerable explanation or interpretation , and in these cases the museum catalogue can give definitive help . Interpretation of iconography , the historical context of works , or personal information about sitters for portraits are only a few of the varied topics which can be spelt out in catalogues . The level of detail may seem much the same as in a catalogue raisonn� , but the stress falls in a different way . In a catalogue raisonn� an individual work is related primarily to other works by the artist , while a museum catalogue entry will extend to other contextual information and comparisons . Some of the work for a museum catalogue may have already been done before the acquisition of a picture . It may , for example , have been part of a private collection which itself was catalogued , especially if the collector in question was rich . In this respect , the scholarly standard of a private collection 's catalogue will be very high , and the sort of information which a reader can expect will be the same . The collection will not , however , be accessible as public collections are . In an art museum works can be studied at leisure , and will receive attention from scholars and experts of many kinds . Besides , works can gain by the company they keep in a museum collection , a landscape being in a group of works of similar date and intentions , or a portrait seen among contemporaries . One of the important features of museum collections is the function they have as touchstones of quality and authenticity . paradoxically , it is in museums that the market in art is defined , since permanent collections place limits on what is available for collectors to purchase . Further , on the basis of knowledge about museum collections , artists can find help in choosing ways of developing the art of the present . The museum is also the place where the closest consideration can be given to the troublesome problems of fakes and other forms of inauthenticity . Museums are at an advantage in making close examination of works in their own collections showing evidence about a picture , say , which can only be discovered by the newest scientific and technological methods . A critic walking for the first time into a gallery may describe a colour in a picture as blue ; it will have been the scrupulous task of a conservator to have established that the particular colour in question was Prussian blue , and thus can not date before the eighteenth century . Old-fashioned amateurs used to admire colours with a golden glow , which conservators have demonstrated were the effect of discoloured varnish . The shape of a picture may have been altered , and the museum , though not a stray visitor , will know the fact . In short the pictures in an art museum have been closely monitored , often through decades and in a few cases for centuries , so full descriptions that appear in the catalogues have a thorough-paced authority . It is also through observation that fakes are unmasked . Some have been living for a disconcertingly long time in museums ; but once doubted , the evidence of inadequacy in a fake is quite often soon in coming . The Metropolitan Museum in New York , for example , proudly owned an early Greek bronze horse , which a sharp-eyed administrator on the staff noticed one day had a ridge . This vital fact proved its method of manufacture did not correspond to its supposed date . The museum made the best of a bad job . Joseph Noble , the observant administrator , announced to an audience of eight hundred , " It 's famous , but it 's a fraud . " More than that , it was " one of the most important classical art forgeries ever discovered " . Some museums have prudently kept a collection of mistaken purchases , and even bought some forgeries deliberately . CRITICAL PATHS A climate of artistic opinion is as tricky to predict as the English weather , and also quite as changeable . Both writers and readers are affected by generally accepted ideas , without necessarily having given them independent thought . One difficulty in describing a climate of opinion is this fact : that many shared views are not stated openly , but assumed . A set of assumptions may be challenged by an outsider , and at this moment these shared views come into focus . To look at the work of an art critic in this way we have to turn to historians of taste for the past and to journalists for the present . When we do this , we find that a critic 's range of activities varies from place to place and period to period . Let us look at the second half of the twentieth century . In Paris art critics are often directly associated with particular galleries , and exhibition reviews may be negotiated for a fee between a magazine or a newspaper and the artist 's representative . In London historians and critics are solicited for opinions by the auction houses , sometimes but not always accepting a fee ; commissions for articles are independent decisions by editors . In New York , gifts of pictures by artists to critics may follow a favourable review , though a critic is likely to refuse payment , even for a catalogue introduction , from a dealer . The variations and exceptions to these brief generalised statements can be found in a number of books , some by investigative outsiders , some in memoirs by dealers and others interested in the market . For other periods , historians are slowly making studies which document the connections of critics and historians with the markets . In 1959 Dore Ashton was dismissed by the New York Times , the charges being that her articles were not aimed at a wide newspaper audience , and her articles on work by artist friends gave evidence of bias ( her husband , whose work she was forbidden to review , was a painter and print-maker called Adja Yunkers ) . John Canaday , the incoming editor of the newspaper 's art page and responsible for the dismissal , had made a challenge to a climate of opinion in which Dore Ashton 's criticism was valued for its sensitivity , and where the art which she praised was accepted . Her supporters included Thomas Hess , Meyer Schapiro , Leo Steinberg , Harold Rosenberg , and Peter Selz , and their intervention , asserting that Canaday had offended Ashton 's " rights and responsibilities as a critic " , resulted in Canaday 's being censured by the American art critics ' association . A case of unwitting collusion by a critic in a manoeuvre by an art dealer occurred in 1961 , when Leo Steinberg wrote an article about Jasper Johns . Johns was a puzzling phenomenon for Steinberg , as one of the artists of Pop Art , then hardly begun . The article appeared in an Italian magazine Metro , who had intended to pay $300 for an article ; but when Johns ' dealer , Leo Castelli , knew that Steinberg was considering an article , he arranged for the magazine to offer $1,000 , paying the difference of $700 himself . Steinberg knew nothing about it . The underlying question for a reader of criticism is what influences are exerted on the critic ; but as in this instance , for long it may be impossible to know the truth . One noticeable feature of American art life is the link between art historical teaching and criticism , not so common elsewhere . The practice of American art historians reviewing or curating exhibitions , not only historical shows , is a normal feature of art life . Part of the reason for this is that the American professoriat is the largest in the world , while the American market for current art is unprecedented ; it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world . The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also play a part , contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society . Critics can also be invested with a degree of respect deriving partly from their academic connections . Another sort of authority derives from money , which a reader of art criticism may find it difficult to dissociate from an object . Historical knowledge is the surest cure for this damaged intellectual condition , as the history of taste will show many examples of the irrelevance of monetary value to artistic quality . Incidentally , the good art critic should be the reader 's friend in refusing to be impressed by art market prices . The English art critic Peter fuller had an honourable record in this respect ; despite Julian Schnabel 's financial success , he refused to be intimidated by market values . Whatever flickerings of potential this young tyro possesses , they can not cover up the fact that he is a painter with the imagination of a retarded adolescent ; no technical mastery ; no intuitive feeling for pictorial space ; no sensitivity towards , or grasp of , tradition ; and a colour sense rather less than that of Congo , the chimpanzee who was taught ( among other things ) a crude responsiveness to colour harmonies by Desmond Morris in the late 1950s . However , potentially educable as a painter Schnabel may or may not be , his work is just not worthy of serious attention by anyone with a developed taste in this particular art form . Readers need also to be wary of the existence of special markets . The explosive prices for Teddy Bears in the last few years indicate how a market can be created , in this case by a mix of merit and nostalgia . What is clearly a dealers ' market is often signalled by the invention of a brand name to group together a variety of material , perhaps rather disparate . Pop Art is an example . Or a brand name may already exist ready for exploitation by a market-maker ; Impressionism , for example , was ready to hand for British dealers to invent a new category of art which they could stretch to calling British Impressionism . The influence of an international market is not easy to be precise about , though the appearance of work in a Biennale or an art fair can be impressive in itself . The critic here may be acting as an exhibition organiser or co-ordinator , critical decisions being mainly limited to selection . Private collections are examples of critical judgement in action , so that both their catalogues and the opinions expressed by collectors are worth consideration . The collector may have pronounced views . Albert Barnes , the rich American industrialist who formed an outstanding collection between the wars , certainly promoted his personal theories . Barnes possessed excellent paintings by C�zanne . In a combative book , The Art of C�zanne , he expounded a theory of rhythm in art which he advanced as the key to C�zanne 's success . Barnes wrote on scientific principles , he said . Here is a passage : The rhythmic movement of volumes and planes in space is so basic in C�zanne 's design that it usually extends to the treatment of the background -- whether that be sky , wall or drapery -- and makes it serve the dual purpose of a screenlike area or space boundary and of a rhythmic sequence of semivoluminous planes which continue the movement of the units in the middleground and foreground ; this sequential ordering thus contributes to compositional unity in the widest sense as well as to the expressive movement of the total form . Another collector with a firm sense of the importance of the pictures he had bought was Douglas Cooper . He specialised in collecting the work of four artists he considered to be the true Cubists , Picasso , Braque , Leger and Gris . In 1971 he was asked to organise , at the Tate Gallery , an exhibition which he called The Essential Cubism . The catalogue amusingly contains some entries with such comments as " Compare and contrast this painting with two works of the " analytical phase " . It would be worth knowing how many exhibition visitors obeyed these examination instructions . Finally , the critic may well face an issue of authenticity . Here is a description by a French expert of a visit to the painter and etcher , Dunoyer de Segonzac . The artist was shown a watercolour : I do n't know what to say . I painted this bit here several times over ; that hill too . But there 's a lack of unity . Is the thing a fake ? I ca n't be sure . Perhaps I was n't on form the day I painted it . The worrying thing is my signature , which is extremely hard to counterfeit . But this one looks impeccable . There 's only one solution , and that is to destroy the picture . It 's second rate , in any case ( he added smiling ) , so the artistic loss to the world will be nil . As for the purchaser , tell him to come to my house and choose another picture -- something that both he and I like . SNAPSHOTS : THE ARTICLES THE SOLO EXHIBITION The acid test for art criticism is the solo exhibition . This is the occasion when a reader can visit the same show and make a personal assessment of how helpful the art critic has been . At its best , art criticism will enable the reader to enjoy or appreciate an exhibition better . This fuller appreciation may result from a short or a long article , even occasionally some unexpected insight or well-phrased judgement ; but it will not come from a brief comment off the cuff , an item of gossip , or a mere listing . The only virtue of these latter newspaper techniques is to bring an event to the attention of a reader . A solo exhibition can vary in scope from the minimum , that is to say a show of recent work , through a more extended selection to the apogee of a retrospective exhibition . We have already looked at writing in catalogues , and can now turn our attention to the critical responses which appear in articles . The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears , as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's dismissal from the New York Times because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the paper 's readers . The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication . Some trial and error should eliminate the laziest papers , whose critics do no more than pillage catalogue introductions , or even press releases . Some latitude can be allowed to serious critics who write for periodicals which go to press a long time before a show is on view ; these critics will not be able to comment on how the exhibition actually looks , as their articles will have been written before the show 's installation . They nevertheless will have seen some , perhaps all the works included , and can thus comment usefully on the artist 's standing , aims and achievements . The content of an article will tend to be determined by its length ; no newspaper article is likely to be more than 1,000 words , which precludes any chance of detailed analysis . Indeed , an article at this length will frequently avoid mentioning any work of art by name , being limited instead to a generalised description of an artist 's work . For example , this passage in an article on Giacometti by the American critic Hilton Kramer : shape a figure or a head from the scrutiny of the model who sat before him , was felt to be an " impossible " assault on an objective guaranteed to elude his grasp ... This " difficulty " was the moral center of his art , the very fulcrum of his style . To it we owe that nervous , spidery line of the drawings -- so quick , so attentive , yet so despairing -- that alerts us to the elusiveness of the subject at the same time that it perseveres in the attempt to render it . The article , called " Giacometti 's moral heroism " , is about a retrospective show of the sculptor 's work ten years after his death ; it does not include the name of any single work . Or an article can be centred on a motif , as this passage about Rothko by Harold Rosenberg indicates : By 1950 , Rothko had conceived his conclusive insigne of a disembodied absolute . This icon consisted of the rectangle of the canvas as a one-colour ground visible along the edge of -- and occasionally through an opening between -- three or four horizontal blocks of color with brushed surfaces and furry borders . For the next twenty years , Rothko 's work consisted of reanimating this pattern with the substance of his emotional life . It was as if he had conceived a latterday , visual version of the sonnet or the haiku . Except that ( and this is decisive in regard to the situation of the one-idea painter ) his format was private -- almost , one might say , the framework of another self , or of himself in another form -- and unavailable to others . A further way of treating an article about an exhibition is to make a comparison with another artist . The painter Patrick Heron wrote for the New Statesman in London in the 1950s , and used this technique for writing about Braque , whom he compared with Picasso . The quotation is from an article of 1954 , at a time when Picasso 's reputation was very high . Heron was anxious to point out Braque 's qualities , so he trailed his coat openly . To suggest , as I do , that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary audience , fed to satiety on brilliant innovation , frenzied novelty and every sort of spontaneous expression , that , after all , permanence , grandeur , deliberation , lucidity and calm are paramount virtues of the art of painting ... The rival genius of Picasso has proved to the world that our age may be epitomized by works which ( show ) his unfailing sense of visual drama , his protean invention and his power of investing his creations with a hallucinatory poetry . Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's work , which , incidentally , was a sort of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time . He argued that Braque enhanced objects : He is infinitely kind to all the things that go into his pictures . Indeed , the kind of life which he bestows on his coffee-pot or coffee-grinder , his table , his chair and window , is just the sort of life we feel these things are really living ! The personality with which Braque invests his jug is something that the jug possesses in its own right . In other words , Braque divines the essential spirit -- one might almost call it the " soul " -- of each object that he paints . For this reason we have the feeling that a Braque jug is just as real and valid , just as much a distinct unity , as the jug that comes from the potter 's wheel . PERSONALITY PROFILES A profile of the artist is another form in which to review an exhibition . When such an article rises above the level of a gossip column , the artist 's profile can be a valuable format . One source of interest can be a description of where the interview has taken place , perhaps a studio , or maybe the artist 's home . After the Second World War , for example , the photographer Alexander Liberman decided to visit the studios of artists who had contributed to a century of painting in France , painters and sculptors closely connected with the School of Paris . He commented on his project : " The more I explored , the more I became absorbed with the mystery of the environment . Why should France have become the focal center of painting and sculpture at this particular time ? What relationship exists between the painting and the vision of reality that the artist has before his eyes ? At no time have I believed that environment is a complete explanation of art . I am sure , however , that it plays an important role . " The photographs were taken over a period of ten years , and eventually they were brought together in a book in 1960 ; ten of the book 's essays originally appeared in Vogue , where the appealing mix of an artist 's conversation along with Liberman 's descriptions and commentary succeeded well . Here is one of the descriptions from the profile on Georges Braque : He insisted that I visit the church and marine cemetery at Varengeville . The small twelfth-century edifice , built right above the steep cliffs that dominate the northern beaches of France , and the cemetery with its hundred tombs and crosses are in harmony with Braque 's colors . The church is gray ; the cemetery crosses are of white marble . The stained-glass windows inside , and the black wrought iron and living or artificial flowers outside , contribute vivid accents . The steel-gray expanse of the northern pebbled beach , overcast with the shadows of the high cliffs , creates the dominant black of Braque 's marines . I understood how much Braque had absorbed the countryside around him . The New Yorker has a good record of commissioning articles . Braque was profiled by Janet Flanner , who also wrote evocatively about Picasso and Matisse . Flanner is rather sparing about details of Picasso 's personal life , knowing it to be so extensively documented . But her selected information has a welcome sharpness : Even the opening report of him comes from an unusual source -- his own vivid memory of how he learned to walk . More than sixty years after the event , while watching a child of his own try out his first steps , he suddenly stated in reminiscence and satisfaction to his most intimate Spanish friend , " I remember that I learned to walk by pushing a big tin box of sweet biscuits in front of me because I knew what was inside . " What must have distinguished him as being beyond normal was his unconventionally high state of consciousness . Magazine profiles may be carefully written and prepared , though their facts are unlikely to be as thoroughly checked as in books . Newspaper profiles are quite likely to be based on interviews , which have an immediate attraction , though a reader will naturally be wary about how accurately the interview may have been recorded . Even taped interviews can only be read with caution , since they may have been edited , and the reader will not be told how . Besides , it is an everyday experience that people are sometimes wrong in conversation , and may not remember events well . Where personal profiles have a strength , however , is in what the critic says about personal reactions to artist and work . One incidental advantage of personality pieces is that the magazines in which they appear may be able to afford good-quality colour reproductions . Unluckily , this may be of little help to the reader if the pictures illustrated are used as mere decoration , and not the subject of critical discussion . This is as unsatisfactory as reading about a picture which is not illustrated . The crux of a personality article is that it aims to satisfy a reader 's curiosity . An editor 's directions to the writer of an article may be to take a populist approach , suitable for a wide audience . The article written to this brief is likely to have an element of sensationalism ; curiosity about sex or money may be deliberately aroused ; conflicts in an artist 's life are likely to be dramatised . An amusing parallel in the film business is an account given by the director Ken Russell of how he sold the idea of making a film about Tchaikowsky ; he described it to his potential backers as the story of a homosexual who fell in love with a nymphomaniac . Similarly , the personal lives of artists may be believed by editors to sell more newspapers than reflective criticism . GROUP SHOWS Reviews of group shows make hard reading . The critic may choose to write about common features in the work of the artists exhibiting ; this may lead to generalisations about the group which take little account of the individual qualities of the artists . Indeed , the assumption that they have characteristics in common may be mistaken or misleading . The alternative , of choosing between artists , is also hazardous , since it refutes the idea that they have a reason for exhibiting together , even if what the critic writes is favourable . A hostile article is even less likely to be satisfactory to a reader . There is no problem for an antagonistic critic to find incoherence and inconsistency in a group exhibition . To begin with , the reasons for which artists show together are varied . An obvious reason is financial , since to share costs of a show is easier for the participants . Another financial incentive is that sales may be generated by the naming of a group . At the end of the twentieth century group exhibitions perhaps do not have the importance that they have had earlier in the century . There are many galleries through the world , and it is no longer so difficult for an artist to show work independently . Solo shows and mixed exhibitions are more common , with the group show playing a less important role in the market . Artists who group together for financial reasons may choose a name which is no more explanatory than a number or numbers . Thus in London at different times there have been groups which have called themselves the Society of Twelve , the Seven and Five , and One/ Four . It could be argued that these groups were formed as much for sociability as for making money , being made up of friends or acquaintances , but at any event their reasons fell short of promoting definite artistic programmes . A word of caution is in order , though , about the names of exhibiting groups . Sometimes a number conceals a genuinely significant programme , such as the Group of Seven had in Canada . This distinguished alliance of landscape artists sought to invigorate their country 's artistic life by bold treatment of wild Canadian subjects . Tom Taylor , mentor and leader , had died before the group had its first exhibition , but remains classed with his friends . They subsequently developed individual styles and separate interests , as is true of most groups of artists , but their initial appearance was defined by a programme . Another sort of title for a group is exemplified by Der Blaue Reiter ( The Blue Rider ) . Forty-three works by fourteen painters were shown in 1911 at the " First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of The Blue Rider " , the publication concerned being an almanac which appeared in 1912 with a drawing of a horseman by Kandinsky on the cover . The second exhibition included thirty-one artists . The main need of these artists was for good opportunities to exhibit their work ; unlike the equally celebrated group Die Br�cke ( The Bridge ) they did not work closely together . Nor did they plan portfolios of prints , as Die Br�cke did ; a practice , by the way , followed by a variety of artists ' organisations including the Senefelder Group in England , which has sold its members ' lithographs from the nineteenth century to the present day . Impressionism is the most familiar group with an artistic programme in the nineteenth century . Several features of its history are worth notice . for one thing , the group did not choose the name , which came from a reviewer 's description of a painting by Monet . Then , the artistic aims of members of the group were quite varied , and some personal animosities caused the alliance to break up . Further , the name was partly kept alive by dealing , primarily by the man most heavily committed , Durand-Ruel . What was perhaps most crucial to the success of Impressionism in financial terms was its modern stance , as closely identified with contemporary life at the turn of the century as Romanticism had been fifty years before . In artistic terms , this modern stance inevitably attracted competition . Seurat and his colleagues argued that Pointillism was a scientifically modern style , while the Symbolists asserted that spiritual values were preferable to artistic programmes of perception . The unfavourable reception of Impressionism by the French critics is notorious ; but Impressionism was not the only group to gain a name from a review -- the Fauves and Cubism share this . From a critic 's point of view , a label , whether ending in " ism " or not , is convenient . The critic writing in a newspaper with very limited space needs such a label to give the reader a general idea of what is on display . Using such a shorthand description leaves space for other topics . Another consequence of the labelling of Impressionism and other groups by critics was that some artists naturally decided that they themselves could do the same job better than the critics . In Western art there had been artistic programmes and manifestos before Impressionism , but in the twentieth century they proliferated . Part of the critic 's task in the nineteenth century , as now , was to interpret art for the lay public ; but what , artists asked themselves , if we interpreted our own work ? from such a thought sprang statements of artistic aims and manifestos , some using the new device of naming a group with a progressive title , such as futurism . De Stijl is an especially bold assertion of identity , the Dutch word for style implying that there is no other style worth considering . The reader in this situation has a choice : the work in an exhibition can be measured against the artists ' manifesto ; or the critic 's interpretation and assessment can be used . The critic necessarily has to take a manifesto into account . Indeed , there is an implicit struggle between critic and artist ; an artist 's manifesto can be seen as a deliberate attempt to pre-empt critical comment and evaluation . One puzzling decision for a critic to make is to decide whether to isolate any one artist as the leading figure of the group . When this is done , there is a tendency for other artists to be compared with the leader to their disadvantage . It is a nice matter of judgement to decide how to treat the various personalities with justice . Sometimes the teacher is absent from the group , as Gustave Moreau was absent from the painting exhibited by the Fauves ; or , like Tom Taylor of the Group of Seven , he may be dead . Only time and scholarship eventually sort out the various relationships of artists who worked together . Artists can be at a disadvantage in group exhibitions as only a small part of their activity can be seen . A small gallery may have space to show work in only one medium ; this may have a distorting effect on the activity of the group as a whole or of versatile individuals . It may also give a misleading impression : for example , the work of German Expressionist painters under the banner of the name Die Br�cke , Kirchner , Nolde and Pechstein was affected by their practice as print-makers , where some motifs and treatment originated . A show of their painting tells only part of their story . The knowledge of a critic is useful here for filling in relevant background information . The critic is also likely to spot the gaps in a group show , when the best works are not being shown , say perhaps because they are in private collections . The politicising of Western art gives the existence of a manifesto special relevance . If the aim of an exhibition is political , the evaluation of art on purely aesthetic grounds is possible , but considered an irrelevance by the exhibitors . In the longer term , it may be something aesthetic will be seen in what was intended as pure politics . The prime example is the Dada movement , whose nihilistic work is now admired for qualities of imagination . It was originally reviled , as the artists intended , for its rejection of conventional values of art and society . MIXED EXHIBITIONS Mixed exhibitions are ideal for spotting talent ahead of the market , as well as being a significant source of income for many artists . The most common sort of mixed exhibition is the exhibiting society , whose history is entwined with the development of art in Europe since the eighteenth century . The shows put on in Paris at the Salon , and in London at the Royal Academy , were a means of creating sales for artists at a turning point in the history of patronage ; as there developed a middle-class market for literature , so there developed a comparable market for art . Denis Diderot gained lasting fame as the energetic editor of the French Encyclopaedia , but he is also rightly celebrated as an art critic . It was in 1761 , that he first wrote an account of one of the Salons , which was circulated with his other correspondence in the fashion of the time by his friend Grimm . Diderot 's standards were those primarily of a moralist , questioning how morality might be fashioned through painting , but he was sensitive to artistic aims ; his essay on painting was admired both by Goethe and Baudelaire . Here is a description by Diderot of a Russian country scene by Le Prince , from criticism of the Salon in 1767 . An old man has been playing the guitar , but he has left off playing to listen to a young shepherd piping . The old man is sitting under a tree , and a young girl is near him ; I think he is blind -- at least , he ought to be . The youth is sitting at a little distance , his shepherd 's pipe in his mouth ; there is a charming simplicity in his dress and appearance ; he has a fine head . The old man and the girl are listening attentively . On the right are some rocks , and at the foot of them the sheep are feeding . This picture goes straight to my heart ; I should like to lean against that tree between the old man and the girl and listen while the youth played . And when he had left off playing I would go and sit by him , and a little later we would all lead the good old man to his cottage . A picture that affects one thus can not be a bad picture . You may say that it is feeble in colour and monotonous in tone -- it may be so , but it touches the heart , it arrests the attention ; and what is the use of all your correct drawing and pure tints , and skill in light and shade , if your subject leaves me cold and unaffected . Painting is the art of reaching the soul through the eyes , but if the picture appeals to the eyes and never reaches the soul , the painter has fallen far short of his aim . In person , incidentally , Diderot was an encouraging critic . Sainte-Beuve tells us that David always spoke of Diderot with gratitude . It seems that David had at first great difficulty in making his way with the public , and was several times unsuccessful in his efforts after fame . It was at this time that Diderot , who often strolled into the artists ' studios , paid a visit to David , and saw a picture which the artist was just finishing . He admired it and talked about the artist 's meaning , and the noble ideas he attributed to him . David listened and frankly avowed that he had not been conscious of all these grand ideas . " What , " said Diderot , " you did it from instinct without knowing what you were doing ! That is better still ! " David was greatly encouraged by this warm admiration expressed by a celebrated man , and it helped to develop his talent . Reviews of exhibiting societies ' shows have constantly presented difficulties to critics , as it is only possible to give brief comments on some of the artists ' work ; how could it be otherwise when an exhibiting society shows several thousand works ? During the nineteenth century to be noticed was good fortune , while to be praised was a professional advantage . Exhibiting societies , once established , bred rivals ; the most remarkable rivalry in the nineteenth century was in Paris , where the choice of pictures for the Salon in 1866 was so generally considered to be unfair that the rejected pictures were shown in a Salon of their own . This enabled some major figures to show work for the first time . By the end of the century , a pattern emerged through Europe of societies of artists breaking away from official organisations , creating seceding groups , of which one in Austria adopted the word as a title , Sezession . The problem of criticising the work in exhibiting societies ' shows is how little space is made available in newspapers for its coverage ; the critic has time to mention a painter or a sculptor , make a brief observation , and then passes on . In this case selection is all , or almost all , as space does not allow for extensive description or interpretation . Nor is there much point in attempting to give a general impression of a show , as there is nothing to hold it together , unlike a group show with a programme or a manifesto to consider . The only possible general comment is limited to a comparison of one year with another , or of one exhibition with some comparable one . The phrase-maker is thus king . An apt combination of noun and adjective , a bon mot , an evocative phrase , is as much as an artist can hope for and a reader can expect . The reader 's only remedy is to go to the exhibition . In Victorian Britain or France during the Second Empire the critic had some influence over taste . It is doubtful how much influence a critic has today , though high claims are made for Clement Greenberg as the promoter of American Abstract Expressionism . A cynic will remember that research into the opinion-forming powers of newspapers has tended to conclude that readers expect to have their existing views confirmed . If so , the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters , while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market . A different sort of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention , and thus newspaper coverage , is the prize competition . Here the critic is absolved from making judgements of his own by the need to report what a jury has decided about prizes . The critic 's standing is thereby reduced , and the description or evaluation of the prize works is less than likely to be uninfluenced by their new position . How then is the reader of art criticism best advised to use criticism to follow the fortunes of artists ? One policy is to try to see more than one review of any exhibition . The notice board at a show where notices are pinned up will give the general idea of what sort of reviews have been written . It is a usual feature of such a comparison that there is a basic level of information which is common to most of the reviews , and it is the mark of a skilful critic to have worked in some personal assessment of works , or some individual response to the show as a whole . The data common to all reviews can be discounted as being neither criticism nor evaluation . The nuggets of real criticism are those views which are evidently based on personal reactions and responses . THEMES AND ARGUMENTS Articles on exhibitions sometimes glide away into topics which have little to do with the art on display . This will be disappointing for a reader who expects at the least some evaluation of the shows . The arguments put forward can be interesting in themselves , but their drift is often towards making the context of the art shown more understandable . Art politics or cultural history are favourite themes for such reviewers , apart from the spectrum of cognate disciplines which may be the specialities of writers who are only occasionally concerned with art . Thematic articles are likely to be found in two sorts of periodicals , general magazines and academic journals , either interdisciplinary or of specialist disciplines . Valuable interpretive ideas may be found in journals of psychology , aesthetics , philosophy , history , religion , sociology , anthropology , even medicine and biology , although these may not be matched up with descriptions and evaluations of art . Such articles may not start with art ; as Rudolf Arnheim said about his book , Art and Visual Perception , he applied principles of visual perception to examples taken from the arts . Only in his more recent work The Power of the Center , published in 1988 , has he been looking from art to the resources offered by psychology . One of the intriguing questions about any thematic article is what motivated the writer ? Some articles are clearly written as a by-product of teaching , perhaps adapted from lectures or intended to form part of a book . Others are contributions to a current debate , using art as a theme , in discussing political issues , for example . Some thoughtful articles aim to make connections , perhaps across national and language frontiers , or between disciplines . The reader 's criteria for judging articles will vary accordingly . Art politics can prove a rewarding topic for a journalist . Tom Wolfe 's book The Painted Word is a witty example of the genre ; it originally appeared in Harper 's Magazine , before being made into a book in 1975 . There are good satirical illustrations by the author , paralleled by a text which makes fun of American criticism , Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art . Wolfe puts his argument as follows : " What I saw before me was the critic-in-chief of the New York Times saying : In looking at a painting today , " to lack a persuasive theory is to lack something crucial " . I read it again . It did n't say " something helpful " or " enriching " or even " extremely valuable " . No , the word was crucial . In short : frankly , these days , without a theory to go with it , I ca n't see a painting . " This overpraise of criticism justifies the book 's title , The Painted Word ; elsewhere , the book has racy descriptions of New York art life , and a headcount by the author of those he considers care about art . A diagram of the art world , according to Wolfe , would be made up , in addition to the artists , of " about 750 culturati in Rome , 500 in Milan , 1,750 in Paris , 1,250 in London , 2,000 in Berlin , Munich , and D�sseldorf , 3,000 in New York , and perhaps 1,000 scattered about the rest of the world . That is the art world -- a mere hamlet -- restricted to les beaux mondes of eight cities . " What Wolfe provides is art criticism in a sardonic mode , created by parodying others . One of Wolfe 's targets is the critic Greenberg , about whom an apologist has gravely asserted : " The significance of Clement Greenberg can not be overestimated . He is the designer and subtle manipulator of modernism , which is the single most important and influential theory of modern art . " Greenberg wrote exhibition reviews for The Nation during the 1940s , but his lasting reputation comes from a collection of his articles , including some more thematic pieces for Partisan Review , in a book published in 1961 with the title Art and Culture . Greenberg 's name has a special glamour because of his successful advocacy of Abstract Expressionist artists against " the dominance of the School of Paris " , as Barbara Reise wrote . Moreover , " His role shifted easily from the alienated critic writing art columns for intellectual magazines to an impresario in the New York art-world judged by his commitment to a specific type of art and respected for its ultimate ( commercial and influential ) success . " Greenberg 's articles are marked by a confident authority , as in the following passage . Looser paint-handling , combined with what remained an essentially Cubist sense of design , drawing , layout , was what artists as different as Gorky and Pollock had in common during the mid-1940s . If the term " Abstract Expressionist " means anything verifiable , it means painterliness : loose , rapid handling , or the look of it ; masses that blot and fuse instead of shapes that stay distinct ; large , conspicuous rhythms ; broken color ; uneven saturations or densities of paint ; exhibited brush , knife , finger or rag marks -- in short a constellation of physical features like those defined by W�lflinn when he extracted his notion of the Malerische from Baroque art . As we can now see , the displacing of the " linear " and quasi-geometrical as the dominant mode in New York ( and Parisian ) abstract art after 1943 offers another instance of that cyclical alternation of non-painterly , or linear , and painterly which has marked the evolution of Western art since the sixteenth century . A more political theme for an article is the issue of subsidies for the arts . The sticking point is , generally , who should get this encouragement ? The National Endowment for the Arts in the United States has been under heavy fire for its choices , as is usual for Ministries , whether in nineteenth-century France or the present-day USSR . Choices for subsidies are in themselves art critical judgements , just as commissions are , and public debate can become enflamed over commissions . The art critic has no decisive voice in such controversies , though arguments can be made by analogy from existing art to what may be done . Another form of article which can include art criticism is a theoretical paper . For example , the cultural theory of the 1970s , according to an article by Victor Burgin on The End of Art Theory , drew predominantly on feminism , Marxism , psychoanalysis and semiotics . In his view the independence of modernism in art has been " further subverted by the demonstration of the necessarily " intertextual " nature of the production of meaning " . Cultural history and theory , it has to be said , have very extensive agenda , and art criticism is perhaps only a sub-paragraph under a secondary heading . The reader may be doomed to disappointment in reading through an article with wide contextual terms of reference if looking for something as simple as descriptions of works of art , their interpretation and evaluation . Articles of synthesis between art and other subjects may include important art criticism . Literary theory is at present in demand as a point of reference for writing on the visual arts . Articles on this sort of theme may appear in art periodicals , but are just as likely to be found in other journals , on literature , say , or history . What is most likely to be useful in such material is the chance that inferences can be drawn by the reader , seeing a similarity in a problem elsewhere with a question in the visual arts . AS THINGS ARE : DESCRIPTION THE OBJECT OF ATTENTION The description of an object is not a simple task . An art object is especially difficult for the critic , as there are many ways in which its description can be approached . Let us take a sculpture , depicting a girl 's nude figure , of bronze , sixty-three inches high , called The Dance Step , by the Italian sculptor Giacomo Manz� . The girl 's slim figure , small breasts , and pony tail haircut are those of an adolescent , while her pose , one foot at right angles to the other , is just a little away from the third position in classical Western ballet . Eduard Trier chose to illustrate this figure in Form and Space , in which he limits himself to two observations : it is a product of refined artificiality ( in comparison with the elemental force of Marino Marini 's sculpture ) , and the girl ( in comparison with a figure by Marcello Mascherini ) is " more reserved , displays a leisurely elegance in her arrested dance step " . Manz� 's girl is thus described by Trier first as an artefact , and then as a person ; his terms of reference are the characteristics of two other sculptors . This skimpy description is not unusual in a survey , and the missing positive evaluation he might have made is only implied in his choice of the sculpture for inclusion in his book . No other information is given about the work itself , although there is a brief biographical note about the sculptor . There are a number of other ways in which the work could The pose , expression and figure of the girl could have been more fully interpreted in several ways beyond the comparisons with the work of two of Manz� 's Italian colleagues . Who is she ? We do not know her name , though it is unlikely that the sculptor did not have a model . The girl is anonymous , just as are the models for some religious scenes described by Giorgio Vasari . He wrote about the famous frescoes by Giotto in the church of St Francis of Assisi : In truth the work exhibits great variety , not only in the gestures and postures of the different figures , but in the composition of each subject , besides which it is very interesting to see the various costumes of those times and certain imitations and observations of Nature . One of the most beautiful of these represents a thirsty man , whose desire for water is represented in the most lively manner as he kneels on the ground to drink from a spring , with such wonderful reality that one might imagine him to be a real person . Vasari praised Giotto 's ability to represent things visible , a highly usual expectation in the tradition of Western art . Paintings which describe the natural world are indeed easiest for the critic to describe , since any observer can compare an object seen with the same thing depicted . This comparison may form the crucial part of a description ; later on , using comparison as a criterion , that a portrait should look like the sitter , that landscape should look natural , and the objects in a still life should be identifiable , a critic can use it as part of an evaluation . A still life is in some ways an ideal picture to describe , as a firm basis can be found in a catalogue of its components . A list can even rise to evoking the mood of a picture , as in this description by the Goncourt brothers of Chardin 's subjects ; " He introduces into his pictures his wash-basin , his mastiff puppy , the objects and the creatures to which he is accustomed in his home ... the pure simple features of the working middle class , happy in its tranquillity , its labour and its obscurity . The genius of the painter is the genius of the home . " People in pictures can be more problematic to describe , since they may not be identifiable , a special difficulty with portraits . The activities of people in pictures can be equally puzzling . Indeed , if the story enacted in a picture is not known , quite wrong inferences can be drawn from what is perceived . The reader of a description needs therefore to be careful about accepting as a description anything more than is actually visible on the canvas or in the sculpture . Within a particular culture , a description can naturally go further in identifying a devout picture of a Virgin and Child , or a dancing figure with six arms as Siva . The Christian painting may be at once a holy picture and a convincing representation of a woman tenderly cradling her son , seen in front of a north Italian landscape . The Siva statue has no such direct representational reference . A critic unfamiliar with a culture will have trouble in formulating a description of a work . Take African sculpture , much admired by European artists in the twentieth century for its bold forms , not representational of the human figure in a Western sense . Frank Willett in African Art comments : African sculpture has been commonly described as frontal , i. e. the figures are symmetrically disposed about a vertical axis . There are , of course , exceptions to this , but asymmetrical pieces are uncommon . Because of their frontality African figure sculptures are commonly photographed or drawn full face , concealing the fact that the sculptor has paid a great deal of attention to the profile view . Then he says something about the formal appeal of this sculpture to twentieth-century Western taste , because of its freedom from the canon of realism : It is easy enough to analyse the formal characteristics of African sculpture in terms of vertical , horizontal or diagonal emphases ; of relative naturalism or abstraction ; of rounded , angular or cubic elements ; or in terms of tensions , rhythm and movement , and this is certainly an enjoyable and satisfying experience , since African sculptors have achieved a remarkable level of expression in what has been called " purely sculptural " form . This account raises two significant issues about description ; one is parallel to comments on photography which have already been made . In seeing African sculpture reproduced , the reader can remember that this art is to an extent being misrepresented by photography . Secondly , the formal analysis which is second nature to a Western critic can be fruitful , even though it could be argued that this is a way of interpreting the objects of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description . A further type of difficulty arises in descriptions of works produced in far Eastern cultures . While a Western eye is familiar with the process of looking , as it were , through an image to what it represents or means , an Eastern critic looks also at the surface of a painting or a drawing , in which a poem or other calligraphic element may form an integral part of the work . Chinese painting and calligraphy are visual arts on much of an equal footing . A Japanese example is the surimono , a friendly greeting for the New Year through a drawing and a message which complement each other . Here a measure of interpretation is integral to the work itself . The long-standing popularity of Japanese woodcut prints in the West has somewhat disguised differences in approach . The undeniable and striking formal qualities of composition in works by such masters as Hokusai and Hiroshige have had demonstrable effects on late-nineteenth-and twentieth-century European art . Nevertheless , such prints are not justly reduced even in description to mere compositional terms . The materials used , for example , merit attention rarely given to paintings in the West whose science is intended to create an illusion . What the reader of criticism deserves , in sum , is an appropriate description . There are some aspects of a work of art which can be measured , for example its size , natural or chemical composition , and some facts can be discovered about works through specialist techniques such as infra-red photography . These may or may not have significance ; what needs to be certain is that descriptions are accurate , for if they are wrong , deductions from them will be valueless . A fragment from an altarpiece can not be appraised in just the same way as an independent portrait ; and a craftsman 's skill is esteemed more accurately when the materials used are rightly identified . PERCEPTION How a spectator views an object is also not a simple matter , despite this century 's increased knowledge of the psychology of perception . A difficulty is that psychology has narrow terms of reference which can give only a few useful results , for example on the question of illusion . A classic example of exposition , though not uncontroversial , is E. H. Gombrich 's Art of Illusion . This usefully explores some of the resolvable questions , in particular those of crucial interest to students of landscape and the human figure . One aspect of illusion is perspective , much valued in the Western tradition . Three sorts of perspective are identified by Leonardo da Vinci in his treatise on painting , as follows : The first deals with the reasons of the ( apparent ) diminution of objects as they recede from the eye , and is known as Perspective of Diminution : the second contains the way colours vary as they recede from the eye : the third and last explains how objects should appear less distinct in proportion as they are more remote . And the names are as follows : Linear perspective , the perspective of colour , the perspective of disappearance . The Renaissance became enamoured of perspective , indeed Vasari thought that Paolo Uccello took it too seriously . He wrote : Paolo Uccello would have been the most delightful and imaginative genius since Giotto that had adorned the art of painting , if he had devoted as much pains to figures and animals as he did to questions of perspective , for , although these are ingenious and good in their way , yet an immoderate devotion to them causes an infinite waste of time , fatigues nature , clogs the mind with difficulties , and frequently renders it sterile where it had previously been fertile and facile . But when Uccello died in his eighties , " He left a daughter who could design , and a wife who used to say that Paolo would remain the night long in his study to work out the lines of his perspective , and that when she called him to come to rest , he replied , " Oh what a sweet thing this perspective is ! " Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance sort had not been used in European medieval art , where the size of a figure often derives from the person 's importance , God the father never being small . A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ; instead , lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer , an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth-century spectator used to photographs . Again , in Chinese art perspective is different from its treatment in the West . There is one sort of Chinese perspective , seen as in the West from a level viewpoint , but this is only one of three treatments of space representation . It can be identified with p'ing yuan , when one is able to see " from the near parts to the furthest parts " . In this , as in Western perspective , the horizon line is somewhere below the middle of the picture . One alternative Chinese perspective is shen yuan , in which the viewer is placed as if on a hill , and the horizon line is thus high up , almost a bird 's eye view . The third perspective is Kao yuan , in which the viewer is looking up towards a mountain scene , as William Willetts puts it , " through successively receding heights represented by flat parallel planes , each with its own horizon " . The point of making these comparisons is that artistic practices affect how a critic should describe a landscape . Suppose a scene is said to be in correct perspective ? This description could mean several different things . Yet such a comment may need to be made , nevertheless , to point out the quality of a picture . The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures , whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects . In a different sort of context , what appears to be an abstract design , devoid of reference to the natural world , may in fact be a stylisation of a person , an animal or an imagined figure . The totems of American Indians , the carvings of Inouk , ancient bronze ritual vessels from China , and many more examples can be found through the world and the centuries . Most African sculpture is not in this category , as characteristically the masks and ritual objects of Africa are more evidently human or animal in appearance . Care has to be taken by a critic in any of these cases to describe works as definitely as possible . A totem , for example , can be described first as it appears , then as an object which has stylised figures in the sculpture . A further example of abstract form which is not mere pattern is Tantric art . A Tantric painting or drawing has a spiritual purpose , to assist the user in meditation . As a sound is a mantra , so an image is a yantra , the two used together making a powerful combination for spiritual exercises . A description of a Tantric painting as a linear diagram may seem uninteresting , but then the effect of such a picture is not meant to be pleasure for the eye alone , but for religious use . WAYS OF DESCRIBING We have thought so far mainly about verbal descriptions , the stock in trade of the art critic . There are other ways of description , which may incidentally be employed by a critic , or can be useful to a reader as a check on the validity of a verbal description . In chapter 4 , on monographs , there were some comments on the photography of art as a complement to criticism ; there are some other issues about how accurate or misleading photographs can be . Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of image-making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is . In truth , the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ; this can be made plain by looking at a picture , say of the eighteenth century , and comparing it with a contemporary print , perhaps an aquatint , and a modern photograph . The images carry different information . The physical make-up of dots in a photograph differs from the lines and granular surface of the aquatint ; the aquatint 's variations describe the picture more eloquently . The art of civilisations other than that of the West are now more readily visible through photography , and within the limitations of the medium , usefully so . But what do tourists actually see during a visit to India ? Are they able to look without too dominant a preconception coming from the Western tradition ? There are amusing archaeological records in the nineteenth century of the inability of even trained artists to record what they saw ; Assyrian figure sculptures , for example , were recorded as having unmistakably classical Greek features by an artist in the employ of the archaeologist Sir Henry Layard . A different sort of description is an artist 's copy of a work . Copying was a well-paid occupation in nineteenth-century France , since private collectors and travellers were happy to have copies of pictures in famous collections like the Louvre . Copying was also part of an artist 's training , practised by Delacroix and G�ricault , C�zanne and Renoir . At the age of sixty-eight Ingres made copies of masterpieces . Accurate copies might be made , but there is in addition a category of interpretive copy , where the artist copies those elements which most appeal to him . This sort of copy is at the same time description and interpretation , the salient points being brought out by the copyist , who gains greater understanding of a masterpiece by his work . It is not altogether satisfactory to call a print by an artist on the same theme as one of his paintings a description . After all , it is an original work in itself . Nevertheless , the differences between painting and print may be instructive , and help the interpretation of both . By other forms of reproduction an image may be more or less degraded , so that nothing can be learnt from them . There remains the courtesy paid by one art to another , as in the poem which Baudelaire suggested might be a high form of critical writing . Or it may be music , as in Mussorgsky 's composition which he entitled " Pictures from an Exhibition " . These forms of art , however , can generally be believed to have only a friendly connection with their inspiration , which , indeed , is normally only the starting point for the exercise of the talent of the musician or the poet . It was a Romantic notion that there were resonances in the natural world and art ; and it was Schiller who argued that music , the visual arts and poetry " always become ... similar in their action on the mind " . THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE Describing the object is not the only sort of description that a reader can expect from a critic . The critic may be willing to share an experience with the reader , sometimes only of the circumstances in which a work was seen , as might be included in a personality article ; but on other occasions the critic may give a fuller account of a personal response to a work of art . This then becomes not a description of the object itself , but of the critical appreciation or dislike that the work gives rise to . A hairline distinction exists between this description of personal experience and the evaluation of a work . In an evaluation the critic may put personal feeling aside . What is an aesthetic experience ? The question has puzzled generations of Western historians , critics and philosophers for at least two centuries because of the difficulty of disentangling the aesthetic from other responses . A pragmatic view is that an aesthetic experience is what is described as such , and as there are varieties of religious experience , so there may be varieties of aesthetic experience . Let us join an American educationalist talking to children about their understanding of art . Michael J. Parsons describes his work in How We Understand Art . He can introduce us to some American girls and boys who spoke up about what they noticed and liked . If Andy thought a drawing by Paul Klee looked " sort of funny " , he said so . Parsons has some sensible reflections about how the children 's comments can be connected with psychological theory . Parsons outlines five stages of cognition , which he has based on the scientific work of Kohlberg . Other writers have used different theories , for example those of Piaget . Herbert Read in his book Education through Art took up the categories of types put forward by Jung . But for our present purpose , Parsons ' young friends will be good witnesses for us . At first , Parsons tells us , " young children rarely find fault with paintings , no matter what their subject or style ... they allow associations and memories freely to enter their response . The common characteristic is the happy acceptance of whatever comes to mind ... paintings are a stimulus to pleasant experience . " This personal and inner satisfaction gives way at the next stage to taking account of the viewpoints of others , and the experience of others . Following this , the children come to realise that pictures are part of a tradition ; finally , children may be prepared to make a judgement going beyond an individual culture . This subtle scheme has advantages over simpler divisions . Picasso 's Guernica is " OK for some but I do n't like it " , as a young boy put it . The first stage starts with a simple liking , " I love blue " , " My favourite colour is yellow " . In the next stages there is pleasure to be found in identifying subjects , and in discovering that pictures can convey messages expressively . The idea that art is part of a tradition is a further step . Whereas in stage two , detail is a pleasure , in stage four the refinement of imagery and simplicity may be enjoyed . Comparisons between cultures become possible in the last stage . This theory of stages in understanding art is helpful , and it will immediately be realised that the first two stages fit in with description , the next two with interpretation , while the final stage is judgement . The theory is not so useful in defining the quality or strength of responses , and is no help in analysing the interactions of responses . The theory is nevertheless of a sort which can be of real use in a classroom . Perhaps the most usual description of aesthetic experience in the last hundred years has occurred when the critic has been faced with the need to react to one isolated work of art . It was Roger Fry 's contention that an object , say a bunch of carrots on a market stall , could be viewed in a practical way as something to eat for supper , or aesthetically . This distinction can be backed up by philosophy and aesthetics , and descriptions can be found of the resultant moments of vision or epiphanies . Our concern , however , is not with the difficulties of aesthetics , but only with what a critic writes of aesthetic experience , and how useful such an account may be . This is an aspect of description , while it can be suggested that other religious , political or social concerns are more properly matters of interpretation . Unfortunately it is often the case that writers do not allow themselves to be so free in autobiographical disclosures as to say exactly how they felt on seeing some work of art . While they may describe the work , they avoid describing their own responses to it . Two honest critics can be given as exceptions , the first a Japanese who recorded a negative reaction to a picture which did not come up to his standards of meaningful symbolism . He is Toru Torada , and the picture , Blue , by Kumai Sugai . " Suddenly I was confronted by a huge and altogether indescribable blue figure wearing a red hat . But the painting said nothing at all to me as I stood gazing at it . It fulfilled none of my expectations and seemed to be merely trying to make me laugh at the fact that it had left me standing there grasping at nothing . And that was all there was to it . " By contrast , here is a comment by an anthropologist who went to see the work of Mark Rothko . " At the end of the exhibition , looking at a painting entitled Black on Grey , and dated 1970 , I tried to pay attention , " bare attention " , to its visual forms . But what I knew and felt kept interfering . " What the anthropologist Jacques Maquet knew was that a few weeks after finishing this sombre painting , Rothko committed suicide . Questions and comments , feelings and comparisons kept interrupting his attempt at contemplating the work . Then , " Instead of struggling in vain to prevent them from reaching my consciousness , I stepped back , as it were , and let thoughts and feelings come and go . I noticed their appearance and also noticed that , left alone , they disappeared too . My previous attempts at getting rid of them had had the effect of reactivating them . I was still overwhelmed by the painting , but I was now aware that I was overwhelmed , and this , somehow , seemed to establish a distance between this emotion and me . " <text id="bnc:6">BACKWATERS IN the course of the 1970s V. S. Naipaul published two novels -- Guerrillas in 1975 and A Bend in the River in 1979 -- which address the theme of alienation , marginality . The orphan modes apparent in the novels are those , respectively , of vengeance and flight . And there are also orphan countries there -- poor places , backwaters , as it might seem , at opposite ends of the earth . Early in 1972 , two corpses were found in graves dug in the garden of a house near Port of Spain , Trinidad . The house belonged to a hustler called Michael de Freitas , latterly known by his Black Muslim names , Michael X and Michael Abdul Malik . In London , where he spent a number of years , he had gained a reputation as a crook and as a threatener of whites and defender of the coloured-immigrant population . One of the corpses was that of a local youth , the other that of an English girl , Gail Benson , who had come to the West Indies as the slavish lover of an American Negro , Hakim Jamal , " God " to his friends , who was eventually to be shot dead in Boston . It turned out that Gail Benson had been stabbed and buried alive . De Freitas was tried , with others , for the Trinidad killings . Kate Millett and William Kunstler went about the world protesting against the trial on the grounds that it was " political " . In May 1975 , De Freitas was executed . With these events in mind , Naipaul wrote a novel . He is of Hindu stock , grew up amid the elaborate racial estrangements of Trinidad , and now lives in England . He is a writer of rare gifts , and among his gifts is a capacity to wound . He had previously written a journalistic piece about the killings , in which De Freitas figured as shabby and contemptible , and Gail Benson as a silly upper-class woman whose accessibility to the knife might almost have been construed as a last desperate act of Sixties modishness : an antic exported from Swinging London . In a second article on the killings , Naipaul 's wife Patricia used the word " antics " to characterise the behaviour of the De Freitas set , which she firmly separated from the serious politics of the Caribbean . I knew Gail Benson slightly when she was a schoolgirl , and remember a pretty moon face , big eyes , a freckled complexion deepening to russet , dark hair parted down the middle -- a nut-brown maid and modern miss who must have wanted to be away from the French Lyc�e in South Kensington , shy , uneasy , wound-up . I was curious to see what shrift she would receive in Naipaul 's novel : the work of a man who has been spoken of by an old friend , the novelist Paul Theroux , as having in earlier times been " merciless , solitary , and ( one of his favourite words ) unassailable " . Well , it can be said that he does not allow his mercilessness to go undetected on this occasion . And yet the treatment of his characters is not exactly what that prefatory article of his might have led one to expect . Guerrillas is set in an imaginary Caribbean country , whose capital city is by the sea . There are mountains nearby . Inland , a great plain . The landscape yields three centres of activity . First of all , outside the city , next to a growth of forest , there is Thrushcross Grange . Named after the mansion in Wuthering Heights , this is a desolate agricultural commune run by Jimmy Ahmed , back from London , where he has been in some vague way a celebrity . He has extracted land and money from business interests , but his revolutionary experiment has foundered from the start . Nathaniel Hawthorne spoke of the " phantasmagorical antics " he had played in describing the socialist community which appears in The Blithedale Romance : the antics played in the commune conceived by Ahmed could also be called phantasmagorical . A nut-brown man by South Kensington standards , he is light-skinned in the West Indies : he is a Chinese Negro , who thinks of himself as a hakwai Chinee -- hakwai , he explains , being " Chinese for nigger " -- and who has not failed to notice that Emily Bront� 's Heathcliff is rumoured to be the Emperor of China . He is also a self-styled haji , or Muslim holy man . He has gathered about him a defecting company of slum boys , with one of whom , Bryant , of the distorted face , his hair done up in small Medusa pigtails , he sometimes makes love . The polluted landscape , and the heat in which it languishes , are important to the novel . The heat , and the drought , have set this country on fire . The hills smoke , mounds of rubbish smoulder , the verges of the roads are charred . All this is felt to testify , not just to a general rankness and decay , but to a conflagration of another kind -- to what will happen if the political and racial tensions of the island can no longer be contained . Gangs and guerrillas are talked of Wealthy people are talking of escape from a Caribbean version of James Baldwin 's " the fire next time " . A white woman named Jane has come here from London , drawn by the glamour of the Third World , supposing herself to have arrived where the action is , where the " doers " are . She is , as she acknowledges , " playing with fire " . For a while she believes that Peter Roche is a doer . Tortured by the regime in South Africa , Roche has written a book about it , and now , in the Caribbean , has joined the firm of Sablich 's as a welfare worker , whose job is to define and to publicise the firm 's good intentions toward the community . It does not take long , however , for Jane to become disillusioned . She " knew " that " she had come to a place at the end of the world " , a backwater where there was no action at all . She lives with Roche above the city in a " Californian " company house on the Ridge : this suburb , barricaded , fireproof perhaps , but lived in by prospective quitters of the country , supplies a further scene for the events of the novel . Every so often , wild disordered men , with matted hair and " unseeing red eyes " , are glimpsed " tramping along old paths , across gardens , between houses , and through what remained of woodland , like aborigines recognising only an ancestral landscape and insisting on some ancient right of way " . One of them has taken up residence in a hut in Roche 's garden . When Jane has Roche inspect the hut , the wild man , with his black face and his pigtails , has gone , leaving behind him " only a vague warm smell of old clothes , dead animals , grease and marijuana " . Perhaps he will be back -- next time . The novel 's third scene or zone is the city itself . The automobile has turned the city inside out , ranging new communities around the periphery and letting the centre rot : not far from the centre is an old slum district where the gangs operate . They are a reality , whereas the guerrillas are only a dream -- phantasmagorical . But they are a reality which Naipaul treats in such a way that they , too , can at times seem phantasmagorical . Everywhere , transistors give off the Reggae beat , making the place a party that never stops , and that might catch fire . A sense of mystery and futility is imparted by events at the Grange and on the Ridge , and that sense is heightened by what takes place in the city when the party catches fire and rioting breaks out . Politicians rush to the airport with their loot . Then American military helicopters drift about the sky : a show of strength which is meant to secure American interests on the island , to make it safe for the bauxite investment . Ahmed does not lead this revolution . No one does . It is not a revolution . It is a mystery . A journalist politician , Meredith Herbert , is made a minister -- perhaps in order that he should be damaged by having to deal with the people on the streets ; he is , perhaps , physically beaten up . His role in relation to the disturbances is never really clarified , nor is that of Stephens , an intelligent boy who deserts the Grange , is in touch with the gangs , and is murdered . The gangs exist as intimations of a power which cancels Ahmed 's claim to be a revolutionary leader . That power is located in the slums , in the kinship and solidarity which prevail there , in sanctions which welfare workers will not be able to comprehend . The angle from which the riots are studied makes them appear distant and unimportant , while also worrying . The same angle was conspicuous in the title story of Naipaul 's previous book , In a Free State , where a coup in a new African country was studied , as it were , out of the corner of an eye ; and it also occurs elsewhere in his work . On these occasions the eye discerns a kind of visibility in " an area of darkness " : this , in fact , is the title of the book which records Naipaul 's " experience of India " . Enthusiasts for explanation , however , might want to explain that this " darkness visible " tends to obscure and diminish what deserves to be understood , and that , for him , there are important countries and unimportant countries , and that the coups and riots of the latter are severely diminishable . Here , he surrounds the politics of his imaginary country with darkness , distinguishes between its politics and what might be seen as the antics of bystanders , and concentrates on these bystanders . At the same time , the reader can be made to feel that , on closer inspection , the country 's politics might prove to be antics too . Naipaul may in consequence be open to the charge of trying to diminish both the Michael X murders and the politics of the Caribbean . It can be said in his favour that the Michael X set seemed very like a fraud and a circus , and that these people had no deep connection with the politics of Trinidad . In that last respect , however , they were like practically everyone else on the island , which may in itself be a reason why we should not be quick to decide that their behaviour lacked political significance , and consisted of antics . Guerrillas , then , is shaped in order to accommodate its three zones , and in accordance with a distinction between the political and the phantasmagorical , though there are moments when phantasmagoria , futility , threatens to envelop the island -- Grange , Ridge , gangs , government , politics and all . It is shaped , besides , in accordance with a dramatic momentum which reaches successive peaks with the two sexual encounters between Jane and Jimmy Ahmed . The encounters are separated by the riots and the second is followed by Jane 's death . Jane is a disgruntled , mean and worldly woman who presents herself as the victim of the men she sets out to attract and soon sees through and rejects . For all her action-seeking , caring cosmopolitanism , she is imperial-insular in outlook , and soon sees through the Third World . When she goes to bed with Ahmed , it is a fiasco . He looks at her in fear : " the cleft was like a dumb , stupid mouth . " Her kiss is hard and wild ; it goes with her " screaming " eyes . The later encounter is prefaced by advice from Jimmy , whose leadership pretensions are by now in ashes : " Be calm . You 're too greedy . You give yourself away when you kiss like that . A woman 's whole life is in her kiss . " Whereupon he calmly buggers her . In Argentina , according to Naipaul 's journalism , such an act belongs to the fantasies of machismo : here , at the end of the world , and of Ahmed 's tether , it bears the mark of defeat . Sodomy is then compounded by a somnambulistic , almost involuntary murder , in which Bryant deals the blows . The novel breathes a certain animus against Jane . In contrast , the portrait of Ahmed has none of the disdain which could be observed in the writer 's article about Michael X. Ahmed 's bluffs are called , but they are understood , and carefully related to his earlier life on the island . His words about kissing are worth hearing . The airmail letters which he exchanges with his liberal friends in England tell a worse story of them than they do of him , and hark back in fine style to that golden time when such friends used to kneel in London mosques with Michael X and other celebrities , squinting up at the Heavyweight Champion of the World 's effulgent arse . Jane is unlikely to earn much sympathy by virtue of the attention given to the environment which produced her dabbling in eventfulness and her poor kiss , and yet the two environments have more in common than would once have been thought possible . It is a quite Caribbean Britain that has made her : a Britain at the end of the world which it used to rule . Ahmed 's revulsion from Jane sometimes seems to be shared by the writer . It is possible to think that this plebeian has been lent some part of Naipaul 's aristocratic fastidiousness , some part of his hostility , while also suffering the consequences of an exposure to these qualities , and to recall that both Ahmed and the author of An Area of Darkness are preoccupied with the hanks of human shit that litter certain landscapes . Ahmed 's revenge is too bad to be condemned by the writer , who condemns his taste in furniture , and who condemns Jane . The tragedies of miscegenation have never been simple -- ever since Othello did what he had to do to Desdemona . But it seems clear that this one bears the marks of defeat and despair , and of a reprisal directed at the liberal England which has let the violator down . Naipaul 's Caribbean country has been looted and exploited in the past , and it is still being looted and exploited . Together with its stultifying racial enmities , this seems to have brought it to a halt , and placed it beyond history . The behaviour of Naipaul 's hustler-hero , his greedy white woman , his pseudo-guerrillas and mysterious gangs , his grafting emergent politicians with their State of Emergency , can be divided into the phantasmagorical and the political . But these dimensions , as I have said , often appear to coincide . His leading characters are seen to be , in some sense , petty and peripheral : but peripheral to what ? To standards of conduct attained in other countries , metropolitan standards , or to something on the island ? The island 's public affairs and significant politics can occasionally be seen , out of the corner of an eye , to be no less invaded by contingency and incomprehensibility and futility than the life and times of Jimmy Ahmed , to have the status of rumour , to be little more than a remote and indecipherable response to a random outbreak of violence . There may be readers who object that the novel makes a mystique of darkness and futility in the course of saying that the whole island is peripheral , arrested . This is a possibility to which an admirer of the novel keeps having to revert . Times have changed since Naipaul began to write about the societies of the Caribbean : these are now less apt to seem , to the outsider , petty and remote . His early comedies might have been taken to represent an unheard-of civility from the back of beyond . Then , in 1961 , came A House for Mr Biswaf : a rich , spacious novel of emergence from backwardness , indeed from slavery , an emergence which is invested with irony . Since then , he has written , among other things , The Mimic Men : while relatively unsuccessful , this is the novel which most resembles Guerrillas , and it undoubtedly " diminishes " the politics of emergent countries by raising doubts about the character of their independence and the motives of their leaders . Over the intervening years , however , the West may be thought to have let him down by declining , diminishing , to the condition of the West Indies : by becoming a backwater , with its Watergate and Ulster , its economic arrests and somnambulistic states of emergency . Naipaul 's readers could well have become inclined to ask why it is that his novels seem to say that there is nothing to be done in , or with , the countries of their concern . What are other countries doing ? Naipaul has long been a reader of Conrad , and Guerrillas can make you think of Nostromo . The geographies are similar . Conrad 's novel is about a fire-prone seaside South American republic , with foreign investors and their concessions : its silver has its lightly rendered counterpart in Naipaul 's bauxite . And the Conrad cry of " Inconceivable ! " may be weighed against Naipaul 's insistence upon areas of darkness . Compared with what we find in Naipaul 's novel , however , Conrad 's Costaguana is a country of the mind : it has the air of having been built to accommodate his meanings . What we find in Guerrillas is a narrative of unfailing fascination which delivers to the senses of the reader a country very like the countries he knows in the real world : equally , his experience of that country is very like his experience of Naipaul 's India , in being rarely subdued by an awareness of the writer 's more deliberate meanings . It is characteristic of the novel that climate and vegetation should count for no less than its comedy of manners , in which the Jewish businessman Harry de Tunja plays an enjoyable part , and that neither of these two elements , so far as they can be distinguished from the rest of the novel , should count for less than the opinions which they help to convey . This is a very different work from Biswas . It is brief and fast : it moves to the rhythms of a single drama , and the pace is perfectly judged . Either book could be considered the masterpiece of someone whom I think of as among the most gifted authors now at work in England . It might appear that the whole life of the later novel is in its sting , but there is more to it than sting . Conrad said of The Secret Agent , another book about revolutionaries , cranks , crooks , somnambulists , peripherals and phantasmagoricals , that it was written " in scorn as well as in pity " , and the same could be said of Guerrillas . But in passing , as they may be thought to have done , from journalism to fiction , Naipaul 's feelings , and their objects , underwent a change . There is less scorn in the novel than there had been in the article , and a pity that must have come as surprise to readers of his work . Some readers were upset by the hostility shown towards the murdered woman , and by the sympathy shown towards Jimmy -- the sympathy of an author noted for his sceptical attitude towards revolutionaries , who had been hostile , in print , to all of the participants in the historical events which supplied part of his plot . There must also have been readers who were led to reflect on Othello 's self-righteous murder of Desdemona , and to reflect that Shakespeare 's play expresses a view of mixed marriages which is both encouraging and discouraging . In both Guerrillas and A Bend in the River the description of a coup , of an emergent country 's state of emergency , is put together with the description of a sexual relationship between people of different races : an affinity is suggested , also apparent in the novella In a Free State . In Guerrillas , the rebellion is mysterious , cryptic , while the sexual relationship is fully lit : a contrast also apparent , but somewhat different , in A Bend in the River . Both novels see the world in colonial colours -- as determined by empires , in the furtherance of which races have defeated and enslaved each other , in which they have met and married , in which a black mercenary might marry a daughter of Venice . For much of its course , the later novel takes all this for granted . It is what is likely to occur . Races insult each other , and make war , and make love , and they may mix these activities up . At the same time , the novel finds more to object to in the less objectionable aspects of these activities than many readers might anticipate . It is the work of a writer for whom , in successive fictions , the theme of sexual dealings between people of different races has necessitated the representation of violence . Rapes and murders occur in this area , and may , of course , have to be treated . And the theme is obviously of high consequence for the portrayal of any society where race is a trouble and where one race has subdued another . The society may be symbolised by such dealings , and experienced through them . Hardship and discontent may declare themselves there , in a victim 's revenge . In addressing itself to such possibilities , however , A Bend in the River , for all its air of simplicity , is never simple . Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim , and the difference between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify . The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin , whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa , as traders . Salim leaves them , takes off on the first of a series of " flights " , and treks to the interior , to a country which appears to be compounded of the Congo and of Uganda , in order to earn a living from a store which he has acquired from a man whose daughter he is expected to marry one day . Reading Salim 's palm , the man points out that he is " faithful " . Salim can be designated a Kenya Asian : the name we give to those hard-working aliens who have been driven out of African countries , and who include the shopkeepers and merchants expropriated in Uganda by Amin . Kenya Asians are now working hard in the darkness and grime of British cities , where Patel is among the commonest names in the telephone directory . Salim is bound by certain of the rules and assumptions of kinship . His kin are entrepreneurs , a wandering bourgeoisie : they have known what it is to be strangers in tight corners , as he himself is a stranger in this tight African town . At the same time , he has wandered some distance from his kin , in spirit . So he is both doubly an outcast and no outcast at all . Unlike many of the towns through which he has bribed his way in his Peugeot from the coast , this one is n't " full of blood " . But it is between coups , or unrests , and has lately been smashed and looted . It is the sort of place which will always revive and rebuild , and in such a place Salim 's part is to make good , carry on . The country , formerly a colony , now " independent " , is controlled by a black " big man " in the capital down-river . An atavistic , tribal , magical resistance spreads about the bush : starveling rebels are hunted by an army , but magic bends the army 's guns . There is far less of the mystification which can be attributed to the account of the troubles in Guerrillas : what we get is the mysterious politics of forest and township as observed by an outsider , by an African Asian who understands a good deal of what is going on . Salim buries his valuables -- from another point of view , his ill-gotten gains -- and an ominous silence descends on the town : Sometimes I thought I could hear the noise of the rapids . It was the eternal noise at that bend in the river , but on a normal day it could n't be heard here . Now it seemed to come and go on the wind . At midday , when we shut the shop for lunch , and I drove through the streets , it was only the river , glittering in the hard light , that seemed alive . No dugouts , though ; only the water hyacinths travelling up from the south , and floating away to the west , clump after clump , with the thick-stalked lilac flowers like masts . Outside the town , a polytechnic and seminar centre has been planted by Presidential fiat . It is headed by the big man 's white man , the Belgian scholar Raymond , who has lost favour with his patron and is sinking into ceremonies of highly-placed sagacity , Salim has an affair with the white man 's white woman , his stylish wife Yvette : radical chic persuades him that he " never wanted to be ordinary again ' . Hitherto a shameful brothel man , Salim is uplifted by their meetings in his flat : " My wish for an adventure with Yvette was a wish to be taken up to the skies . " Blood flows within the town ; Raymond 's work on a collection of the President 's speeches , which could restore him to favour , languishes . Presently the affair ends in insult : Salim beats Yvette and spits on her , and flies to London , where he gets to know his intended bride . When he returns to the town , he is arrested , but is set free by Ferdinand , an African promoted from the bush whose patron he has once been . Salim makes good his escape on the steamer -- bound , we take it , for his bride . The family slave boy , Metty ( the name means half-caste ) , who had come to live with him , is firmly left behind . Salim is now homeless in the sense that he has shed an old tendency to nostalgia : " the idea of going home , of leaving , the idea of the other place " , he takes to be weakening and destructive . This feeling is added to a previous illumination , to a stoicism which believes in " the unity of experience and the illusion of pain ' . " Salim tells Salim 's story . It is not Naipaul 's ; it does not constitute the author 's testament or confession on the subject of race relations and the rest of it . The novel ( or so I hope ) signals a separation between author and narrator with its very first sentence : " The World is what it is ; men who are nothing , who allow themselves to become nothing , have no place in it . " An early passage separates this man , who does not want to be nothing , from the trading elders of his family -- pessimists who could take risks , and were consoled by their religion . I could never rise so high . My own pessimism , my insecurity , was a more terrestrial affair . I was without the religious sense of my family . The insecurity I felt was due to my lack of true religion , and was like the small change of the exalted pessimism of our faith , the pessimism that can drive men on to do wonders . It was the price for my more materialist attitude , my seeking to occupy the middle ground , between absorption in life and soaring above the cares of the earth . Elsewhere Salim separates himself from the doers and makers of the big world beyond him , of whom it is said : " They 're making cars that will run on water . " Such people are " impartial , up in the clouds , like good gods " . The men in the bush are watched by gods who are barely a jump above their heads : these white gods are more remote . Salim reads about their doings in his magazines of popular science , and letting Ferdinand into the secret of his interest , he feels he is revealing his " true self " . But if his " true nature " is to be romantically on the rise , and to have " ideas " , it is also his nature to occupy the middle ground . It is n't lost on him that his reading matter -- popular science , pornography -- is " junk " . For much of the time , he is the achiever who tries for a reasonable percentage return . Salim presents himself in a light which requires the reader to be told that , although he himself has been making good , he is grieved , or affects to be , by the discovery that the slavish Metty has been getting on : " You 've been very much getting on as though you 're your own man . " Their relationship has tenderness in it , and treachery . Metty betrays his master and is then left in the lurch , predicting a future whose likelihood the novel does not lead us to discount : " They 're going to kill and kill . " Metty is a misfit , as Golding 's Matty is in Darkness Visible , a novel which appeared at the same time as Naipaul 's . English fiction loves such people ; it never tires of the lurch , of such areas of darkness . Salim 's outlook incorporates a version of that of his friend Indar , who teaches in the polytechnic for a while , and lends himself to the philanthropic white-liberal cultivation of the African experience , where some of the best comedy in the book is located . At one point Indar recounts his struggles and illuminations . " Raised " from the ruck , originally , by his family 's wealth , he does n't want to " sink " , and rejects " the idea of defeat " that prevails in the Third World : " I 'm tired of being on the losing side . I do n't want to pass . I know exactly who I am and where I stand in the world . But now I want to win and win and win . , Salim , too , wants to win , and his affair with Yvette is a victory : All my energy and mind were devoted to that new end of winning the person . " In possessing her , he is both taken out of , and placed in possession of , himself : " She gave me the idea of my manliness I had grown to need . " When the friendship begins to fail , he says : " What she drew out of me remained extraordinary to me . " The affair seems to him to belong to the town , to have no future , and they are parted when the town comes under fear and hazard . He finds himself " considering the idea of flight " , and the idea of defeat : " 1 suppose that , thinking of my own harassment and Raymond 's defeat , I had begun to consider Yvette a defeated person as well , trapped in the town , as sick of herself and the wasting asset of her body as I was sick of myself and my anxieties . " But the fit of jealousy in which he beats her would appear to mean something more than these words of explanation enable one to understand . This jealousy may be felt to be like Othello 's in having more to do with difference of race , and with the jealousies of race , than the jealous man , or than the work he belongs to , seems disposed to state . Three of literature 's myths underlie the narrative . They are myths of the foreign woman , which bring together achievement and betrayal , achievement and desertion . Of the stories I have in mind , Othello and Desdemona , Samson and Delilah , Dido and Aeneas , only the third is spoken of , and it is spoken of oracularly . The town has two Classical mottoes , one of which consists of Latin words carved on the ruined monument near the dock gates : Miscerique probat populos , et foedera jungi . " He approves of the mingling of the peoples and their bonds of union " : that was what the words meant , and again they were very old words , from the days of ancient Rome . They came from a poem about the founding of Rome . The very first Roman hero , travelling to Italy to found his city , lands on the coast of Africa . The local queen falls in love with him , and it seems that the journey to Italy might be called off . But then the watching gods take a hand ; and one of them says that the great Roman god might not approve of a settlement in Africa , of a mingling of peoples there , of treaties of union between Africans and Romans . That was how the words occurred in the old Latin poem . In the motto , though , three words were altered to reverse the meaning . According to the motto , the words carved in granite outside our dock gates , a settlement in Africa raises no doubts : the great Roman god approves of the mingling of peoples and the making of treaties in Africa . There is irony here . We are made to feel that the reversed meaning is wrong . This is a book which takes for granted , and which has doubts about , the mingling of peoples , and it is a book which takes pride in its chosen people -- Salim 's people and , in some measure , Naipaul 's . Virgil 's Aeneas leaves a burning Troy to go on his adventures , effect his betrayal , and arrive at the Tiber , where an empire is to rise . Salim is an Aeneas who makes it to London , where those of his blood are founding a way of life , and he has his Dido both in Yvette and in Metty . Perhaps this much can be said without suggesting that the book is an epic for Kenya Asians , which tells of a people threatened by nobodies , nothings , and managing to survive . Nor is it a one-sided account of the injustices suffered by this people , or a defence of the energetic stranger . The myths are not all equally available to the novel , and they are not enough to explain it . This lucid and candid prose , strong in the detail of a particular time and place , often ignores , and can on occasion seem to depart from , the sense of the literature it embodies . The offended looks of the muzzy black citoyen who is put in to own Salim 's store when trade is politicised are funny , and important , and owe nothing to the Aeneid . But those who would prefer to explain the book as a comedy of manners , or as current affairs , might have difficulty in explaining the prominence given to the love affair . The plot states that an attachment to a strange woman , a woman who does not belong to this community of strangers , is succeeded by a return to the community , and by the dispersal , and survival , of the community . Salim states that he was having a rough time , and was tired and suspicious of Yvette : he does not say that a tribal god commanded him to leave her . It may be that neither statement need be held to subtract from the other , but there could well be some dispute as to which of the two is the more deeply entrenched in the novel . Salim gets out of Africa , and as he does so , there seem to be allusions to the journey upriver in Conrad 's Heart of Darkness , which also ends ( though by no means hopefully ) with an Intended . When his steamer quits the town , it is attacked by rebels , but manages to fight clear . Meanwhile , in this closing scene , the water hyacinths proceed towards the sea , as they have been doing throughout the action . They keep coming , like immigrants , or refugees , like the South-East Asian boat people subsequent to the novel . Salim 's flight to whatever is to become of him can be compared to the movement of these flowers , and to the Romeward journey in Virgil . His fortunes are those of a solitary who is due to return to his people and to chance it with them in a further foreign place . And they are those of a hero , as well as a drifting hyacinth . He is a hero , with a hero 's faults : an achiever and an adventurer who is also a victim and an outcast , a shameful man and a faithful family man . Subtly mythic and ethnocentric , the novel is one of Naipaul 's most rewarding . It speaks of the separation of races , and of a world which mixes them up . But if it sometimes seems to be saying , on Salim 's behalf , that race or kinship wins , it is also the case that it is full of losers , that it has a lively feeling for the Africans of market and bush , and for their African troubles , and for the situation of Salim as someone evolved or emerged from a tribal narrowness to an experience of sexual love which is liberating and dramatic , and that it does justice to Metty 's last state , left behind in the dangerous town at the bend in the river . Poor Boys RONALD Fraser 's In Search of a Past was published in 1984 , and Ralph Glasser 's Growing up in the Gorbals in 1986 . These are books by middle-aged semi-Scots who have chosen to publish accounts of their early lives which lay stress on the troubles they experienced , on the troubles inflicted , within their respective environments , by poverty and servitude , and on the responsibility of relatives for some of what the writers had to suffer . The question could be thought to arise of whether they are seeking revenge . Authors are not supposed to avenge themselves in their writings , but they do , and if they were to be prevented , there would be far fewer books . I am not confident that either book may be said to be well-written ; that question , too , could be thought to arise . In Search of a Past affects not to be written at all -- so much as researched , recorded and compiled . But the editorial method which is applied to the data has much to display that is well-spoken . They are both interesting books because they tell interesting stories , and are arranged to dramatic effect in interesting ways . Juliet Mitchell has called Fraser 's book " a miniature masterpiece " , while , according to Chatto , Glasser 's " may well become a classic of modern autobiography " . Both men made for the Mediterranean eventually , for reasons which may have involved a respite from British miseries and injustice . These were located , in Fraser 's early life , amid the flatlands , and the privileged high ground , of Southern England , and , in Glasser 's , amid the antique squalor and grimness of the Gorbals district of Glasgow , now erased by developers and replaced by the squalor of the high-rise estate . Fraser was to be the author of Blood of Spain , an oral history of the Civil War . Glasser was to be the author of a study of a Calabrian village , and the Spanish war bears a bleak meaning in the story he tells here . His adult life has been spent as a psychologist and economist , engaged on problems of development in the Third World . He has published a second volume of autobiography , in which he deals with his years as a student at Oxford before and after the world war , and is now bursar of one of the colleges there . Ronald Fraser 's book arranges a marriage between Freud and Marx . One law for the rich and another for the poor , as the two systems can be made to seem , are laid down together in a book which commemorates a desertion , on the author 's part , of the rich for the poor . He had hit on the " aim of combining two different modes of enquiry -- oral history and psychoanalysis -- to uncover the past in as many of its layers as possible " . He is saying this -- outlining the aim -- to his analyst in the course of the therapeutic sessions whose speech forms part of the oral record that constitutes almost all of the book . He is to learn about the troubles of his early life by interviewing the servants of the family and by submitting to the interviews of psychoanalysis . The analyst had previously referred to their sessions as a " voyage of inner discovery " : Fraser thinks that his tape-recordings make possible a " voyage into the social past " . The latter trip may enable him to discover the " external objects " , the analyst thinks : " now , through analysis , you 're seeking the internal objects . " " And the two do n't always coincide " , Fraser replies : " That 's my split vision . Formed by the past , a person is also deformed by it . " The exchange has roused the analyst to contributions that are firmer and more energy-consuming than those he generally vouchsafes : " it 's not the past but what we make of the past that shapes our future and present . " Fraser observes that " analysis is more limiting because it recreates the past only in the forms in which it was internalised or repressed . , Not every reader of his book can have come to it believing the chauvinistic claims that have sometimes been issued on behalf both of psychoanalysis and of oral history , or prepared to believe that these pursuits could be successfully combined . But it does not take long to decide that the experiment is being conducted with skill , and that the pursuits have at least a little in common . A piece of oral history may be meant to do without a presiding historian in much the same way in which an analytic session may be meant to do without a presiding analyst ; theoretical presuppositions are subject in each case to a show of suspension , though it is clear that the theories of Freud and others will be present in the consulting-room , and that oral historians may be sympathetic to socialism and to the methods of Marxist historiography . Fraser 's book is not without its evident presuppositions , and not every reader will feel that this autobiographer , having perused and digested his tape-recordings , talked to his analyst and completed his inner and outer voyages , knew something radically different about his past from what he had known before : that something had been found , or proved . He had lived with his past for the best part of fifty years , and his book tells what he had come to know of it over that interval of time , with help from the theories of Marx and Freud . And in so doing it can often convey that a past is not a thing to be discovered . As the analyst said , it is not discovered but made . Ronald Fraser was not trying to determine , like certain historians of former times , what his past " really was " . But there is some question of a pathogenic secret , of the recovery of material hitherto repressed which influenced his perception of his mother : and his understanding of the past would certainly appear to have been enlarged by his researches . He talks of himself as " split " , and as implicated in splits of a wider incidence . A split appears to be spoken of in the conversation from which I have just quoted : formed by the past , he is also deformed by it . But this is only one aspect of the bifurcation he describes . Fraser 's fork took several forms , as I say : or one might prefer to say that there was more than one fork to reckon with . Born in Hamburg , he was transferred to the Manor House at Amnersfield , the son of a remote German-American mother and of a sour , withdrawn , irritable Anglo-Scottish father , who would retreat behind the Times and spend the evening in lonely state , smoking his pipe in his kilt . He was never to say hello to you , and he once said that he would not be interested in his child " until he can go out shooting with me " . ( Elsewhere , another angry gentleman of the period , Evelyn Waugh , had waited for his children to be of an age to converse with him , before taking an interest . ) The household shot , and it rode , to hounds and in all directions , but Ronald Fraser had no love for horses . The poor little rich boy was looked after by a second mother in the person of strict Ilse , from Germany : this did a great deal , but not enough , to relieve the isolation he felt -- which , as his researches disclosed , was to be a factor in the isolation and rejection suffered in turn by his younger brother , who also left for the Mediterranean . When friendships finally became possible for him they were with children of the lower orders . His parents did not get on and parted during the war , which put an end to the old hierarchic world of Amnersfield , where you were not to look at your masters when they came up the drive , but to hoe on regardless . Mrs Fraser was suspected in the neighbourhood of being an enemy spy ; presently she remarried -- her new husband a jolly , but for the son disturbing wing-commander . The testimonies in the book were obtained mostly from the underlings of the house , led by sly , supportive Bert , a man who was able to take and to give pleasure -- a fine portrait , which is also a self-portrait , of a second father . Bert 's testimony , and Ilse 's , are probably paramount . " The image you give " , Fraser tells Ilse , meaning the image she gives of himself as a boy , " is one of dependency , extreme docility . It was my natural character , you think , evident from birth ... " . Ilse had been trained in an orphanage , and he then tells her , with a smile : " I would n't claim any privilege that an orphan was n't entitled to . " He reverts to the point with the analyst : " Supposing I did n't have what a child objectively should be entitled to ... " . In coping with the unsaid and unsayable , oral history is impelled towards aposiopesis . The analyst 's response is apt to consist of an " ... " But if the work is oral history , it is literature too -- a disclosure of predicament and bereavement . The enigmatic three dots to which it is impelled are those of a romantic orphan , as well as those of his reticent doctor . A romantic orphan , though , who was able to accept that he had caused his brother to suffer . In all this there was plenty of scope for an awareness and endurance of contradiction . Contradictions , splits , can readily be perceived , by those minded to perceive them ; pursuits that can be married , like oral history and psychoanalysis , can be found to separate . What matters is what happens when the individual , who incorporates his past , incorporates and transforms the divisions which are part of that past . Fraser reflects : " Two mothers and I 'm torn between them ... " . Torn between " the distant star and the cold , close moon " . And neither of the women was to prove " sufficient " . " You split them " , prompts the analyst , " into the good and the bad mother . " The analyst proceeds : 'All mothers have to be frustrating as well as loving . But being consoled by another mother who seems unfrustrating makes it harder to reconcile the two ... " . This appears to be a key point , but it is one that is left controversial . It is possible to imagine that for some people such consolation might make it easier to reconcile the two , and to wonder what it was that made the difference in Fraser 's case . There were other things that had to be reconciled , and we hear presently of " a role of inherent superiority which came to me from outside , from the servants among others . Inside , however , I felt inherently inferior , inadequate to fill the role . That was the split ... " ( Fraser 's dots ) . He asks the daughter of the refugee cook , remembering the days when he made love with this daughter , if she had known two different boys . Later in the book Mr Fraser recognises that he has talked both of rubbing out the past and of preserving it : " The aims seem contradictory , do n't they ? But they 're the same . I kept the past alive out of a desire for revenge . One day I would write it -- and them -- off the face of the earth ... " . He is referring to his parents , I think . Later still , the analyst suggests that Fraser may want to offer reparation , by writing this book , for the guilt he had felt in relation to his father , and Fraser asks : " For wanting to destroy him so I could have my mother to myself ? " " Uh-huh ... " . " And for wanting " , Fraser adds , " to destroy her ... " . Is the book , then , a " monument to destruction " ? The servants , who did much of the living which is commemorated here , and his parents , who did so little of it , are placed well within reach of an impartial sympathy in a work which nowhere feels vindictive , and which declines to settle for any final understanding of what went on . Despite its title , and for all Fraser 's grave and civil investigative demeanour , the book does not exhibit this past as something to be searched for , uncovered , so much as something which is unfindable , interminable . Understanding is deferred , rather as it is in certain recent theoretical accounts of the way literature works . But this does not diminish the importance of the provisional discoveries which it contains , which the writer has moved to incorporate . From the point of view of the people of the Gorbals in the Thirties , fox-hunting and psychoanalysis would have been practically indistinguishable concerns of the rich in the Sassenach South , of the " high heid yins " of the world -- an expression of the poor in Scotland then , which Ralph Glasser uses . And there is a point of view from which Ronald Fraser might be seen as a man of Marxist leanings who paid a professional adviser what may have been a fair whack of a working man 's wages to enquire with him into the deficiencies of his affective life . This is a split that can rarely have been witnessed in Glasgow -- which does not indicate that he was at fault in consulting his analyst , but does indicate that these autobiographies are sited in very different places . Nail on the Banister by R. Stornaway , alias R. Scott , is an eloquent Scots joke of the Thirties , and it allows one to say that Glasser 's banister was a bed of nails , but that his slides may have been less painful than Fraser 's . He could well have been called a victim , and his book consigns itself , as Fraser 's does , to that large literature in which the sufferings of victims are recounted : but he does not see himself as a romantic orphan . He belonged to a family of immigrant Jews which had fled to a Glasgow tenement and a community of Yiddish-speakers within the city . Round the corner was Dixon 's Blazes , a blast furnace , and the Workers ' Circle , where dreams of socialist emancipation were debated -- dreams which were soon to fade for Glasser . Nor was he able to believe in the religion of his community . Anti-Semitism was not , it appears , a major threat in an environment where many kinds of threat and affliction -- such as its gangster debt-collectors , the " menodge men " -- competed for consciousness . His mother died early , worn out by making ends meet and by her husband 's gambling . Glasser still stands in awe of this formidable , feckless man . His sisters were to flee the family , precipitating an ordeal of severance which compounded others and marked him to the quick . He wants to go to university , turns up to listen to Einstein , studies hard ; but his father wo n't have it , and at the age of 14 he becomes a soap boy in a barber 's and then a presser in a garment shop . The Gorbals comes across , in careful descriptions , as a ferocious place . It should be seen for what it was , and especially by those who feel like regretting its erasure , and alleging that its replacement has made an environment which may be even worse -- of tower blocks filled with heroin and despair . The trouble is that the allegation has begun to seem convincing . " The hovels and the vennels " of the nineteenth-century Scottish city have been projected into the sky ; the lower depths of the Thirties have not gone from urban Britain . And we have a government which has been slow to worry whether the people there die of Aids . At one stage Glasser is invited to look at a tenement close -- by Bernard , a Communist who was to fight in Spain and return with an altered mind . In Spain Bernard questioned the principle that the end justifies the means -- " the human price was too high " -- and it had almost " cost him his life " . ( But can this be said to have been what happened ? The book has explained that , having been a murderer of unreliables for the Republicans , he was shot at by a rival and went straight back to Glasgow . ) At this earlier stage Ralph goes into the close and takes a look at the human price of capitalism . Nearly all the stone steps in the first flight up to the half-landing were broken , with jagged edges where bits of tread had fallen away . Some had almost no tread left . Plaster had come away from the walls from ceiling to floor , and along the lower part the bared cement , originally grey , was stained yellow and smelt of urine . On a patch where the rough surface of brickwork was exposed , someone had vomited , probably a passing drunk whose sense of propriety , demanding privacy , had deterred him from being sick in the street ; or a returning resident who could not wait to climb the few steps to the communal toilet on the first half-landing . The detritus had stuck to the pitted surface in a wide streaky band as it slid lumpily from chest height to the floor . Judging by the strength or its smell , a mixture of beer and fish and chips , the vomit was recent . Another powerful smell , of decaying rubbish , came mainly from the ash-pits at the far end of the corridor , but also from a deposit scattered over the floor . Despite the cold wet wind blowing in hard from the street , the cloud of mephitic vapours lingered stupefyingly about our heads . " Mephitic " might be compared with Fraser 's " ulcerous " in " Resentment wells up like an ulcerous vapour " . Glasser 's vapours are different from Fraser 's . They stink , while Fraser 's are mental . Both men lived through the Depression , but Fraser 's depressions were only indirectly linked with the hardships of people he knew . At the same time , these hardships are a focus of his attention . The two words carry a note of declamation -- a note otherwise absent from Fraser 's account . Glasser 's prose is sometimes declamatory and sententious in an old-fashioned sort of way , and sometimes awkward ( " Hidden in the near future , he was to be proved right " ) . But it rises to many of its ferocious and grievous occasions . We are in the Scotland of TB , pneumonia and drink , in which sex is spoken of as a matter of men attacking women . At the end of the corridor which he describes , before you get to the rubbish , is the place where the young make love . Their elders make it upstairs in the flats , attended by small children -- brothers and sisters who grow up in the Gorbals , Glasser says , to try it with each other . About these matters it seems to me that he writes really well , in a manner that might suggest the intent translation of a Latin author anxious to tell the truth . Afterwards she parted the curtains and came out naked to lift the unsleeping , finely aware child back into bed , to lie between her and the man lying open-mouthed in post-coital sleep . And then mother and child might lie awake for a while , locked in unique perplexities . She , her body prompting her still , with no finality in her , turned her world over and over again in her mind 's restless fingers . The child , possessed by wonder and nameless hauntings , tried to join together the heavings and creakings and groans and gasps and little cries he had heard as he lay on the floor , his mother 's disturbed concentration now , his father 's stillness as if felled , and the sticky warmth in which he lay between them , something more than the sweat that was there before , a substance he divined as elemental , mysterious , newly decanted , that touched his flesh and his senses with profound , unattainable meaning . At the beginning of the book a dear friend , Charlie , another immigrant boy , leaves for Russia with his family -- for the land , they hope , of the free . Ralph strives to address " the high heid yins of Russia " to solicit news of the family , and receives his letter back from the Embassy in London , stamped : " Communication not permitted . " And the family was never heard of again . Glasser orders his events thematically , while also wanting to tell a story and to spring surprises . Charlie 's departure is the first of several , and this event is succeeded by the announcement of a further theme when the rabbi 's thunderings pass over the heads of his congregation and the writer notes : " in later years I would wonder how different my life might have been if a few people , those closest to me , had been frightened -- just a little . " Among those closest who should have been frightened was Annie , his girl for a while . Annie left him , and then , pregnant , offered herself in order to saddle him with someone else 's child -- and this when he had just received a telegram awarding him a scholarship to Oxford . Just when his ship was coming in she might have set fire to it . He condemns her for trying this trick , which is followed by a terrible fall downstairs in the course of an attempt to end her pregnancy . She had known that his love for her would remain , and " for her to have acted on that knowledge " in resorting to the deception " made her deed unforgivable " . Those closest to him who should have been too frightened to behave as they did include his father , but they also include his sisters , who struck out for themselves in a fashion which has him siding with his father . Lilian , the older sister , errs by studying hard to become a money-minded businesswoman with a grudge and a smart flat , and by blackmailing her employer , also her lover , by means of an abortion . Glasser talks of her as if , in walking out , she had gone on to walk the streets . She is seen to suffer for what she did , and Mary , the other sister , likewise " paid heavily " : let down by an Indian student with whom she had been having a long affair . " She set higher store by emotional security " than her sister , " and thought she would find it with a man soft-hearted and caring and pliant , far removed , as she thought , from father 's toughness and uncontrollability . " Glasser thunders on : " Both Lilian and Mary invested too much emotional capital in their opposition to father , whose influence naturally remained dominant , try as they might to escape ; and this imbalance distorted their view of relationships and of the world . " This is a male view of the matter , in which women are attacked , and which had me admiring these ugly sisters . It is made clear that the boy was exposed to serious danger by his father 's irresponsibility and by his sisters ' departure : but his sisters had been exposed to this father too , and had had to defend themselves . A father 's influence which has been revealed as destructive and all but disastrous is thought to have remained dominant -- as was only natural -- until the women broke away for good . An author is taking his revenge in setting down these judgements , begrudging the grudges of others -- while uttering , this once , the cry of the deserted child . Neither of these books , however , could be said to be intent on revenge . Glasser presents a full picture of the behaviour , good and bad , which he encountered in an area of maximum difficulty , and it is not often that such a picture has been presented . The familiar and approved accounts of Scottish life have long favoured a country of hills and fields and firesides , where braw lads and bonny lasses dance reels and go on , after early struggles , to better things ; where the best thing of all is the kind landed family that comes up from London to visit them , famous for its stables , castles and ceremonies . Another fallacious account comes to mind . The literary naturalism of the last century went to the poor and itemised their way of life , producing for adversity truthful , distressing inventories and interiors -- as in George Moore 's novel of the Nineties , Esther Waters , which starts with a manor-house , servants and horses , and travels to Soho for compulsive gambling and a fatal cough . In Glasser 's book , and in Fraser 's , the activities of the poor can be seen as activities which had been performed , and written about , in the past : but these are books which intimate that the lists and specifications of a caring naturalism -- features by which they have indeed been influenced -- were never exhaustive : that the truth-tellers did not tell it , and that the omissions were systematic . The sexuality of the past , and the extent of the intimidatory violence , were only very faintly registered . Esther had quite as hard a time of it as Annie , one might feel , but even so , Moore 's spirited novel can be thought to settle for an anodyne poverty . To say this is not the same as complaining of his acknowledgement that poor people can have a good time . No lie in that . There were pleasures for both boys in the course of their growing-up . For Glasser , there was Annie , study , socialist hikes and camp-fires in the hills outside the city ; for Fraser , there were model aeroplanes , and a mute attraction shared with a boy of lower status , and there was Bert and Ilse . But what is most striking about both books is the sense they give of how desolate and enclosed an adolescence could be , at opposite ends of the society . The better things presumed to be in store for Glasser when he went off as a scholarship boy to a glamorous university in the South of England are , in a sense , the subject of Gorbals Boy at Oxford , his second volume of autobiography . The refugee from Glasgow saw through , and stood up to , some famous middle-class progressives , was asked to spy on student Communists , was asked , by a girl at a party , to " do something ! Julian 's got a knife . " At another party , in the South of France , a reefer is placed between his lips by a girl whose trousers fall down . " I had scaled magic heights and found obscurantism , absence of hope , a world infinitely darker than I had ever imagined possible from where I had stood in the Gorbals . " I can only hope that the bursar now inhabits a wholly healthy Oxford . Long live pastiche PETER Ackroyd 's novels Hawksmoor and Chatterton do much to explain one another . Both books mingle old times and new times , and both give expression to fantasies of replication , with Hawksmoor a hard act to follow . Its old times are brilliantly rendered , and its appeal is in part generic . The biographer of T. S. Eliot , who was himself to speak of the " dark " experience , of the " rude unknown psychic material " , incorporated in his poem The Waste Land , can be seen in Hawksmoor to contribute to the tradition of romantic fabulation which began with the Gothic novel -- a tradition in which darkness is privileged , in which a paranoid distrust is evident , in which can be read the evergreen message that the deprived may turn out to be depraved , and in which there can be two of someone . Hawksmoor speaks the words of romantic duality , and is in a number of ways a double book . It consists of two alternating narratives , one of which is set in the eighteenth century and the other in the present , with the earlier delivered in the first person . Each of the two principal actors glimpses his double in passing , as a reflection in a glass , and each stands to the other in the same relation -- a relation which presupposes , as in many other Gothic texts , some sort of metempsychosis or rebirth . Both of these men are disturbed or mad . Nicholas Dyer is imagined as the builder of Nicholas Hawksmoor 's churches in the East End of London ; the enlightened edifices of a rational Christianity are thereby ascribed to a devil-worshipper , while the name " Hawksmoor " is assigned to the Detective Chief Superintendent who , in the later narrative , frets himself into a delirium over a series of stranglings which takes place in the vicinity of the churches . The later crimes duplicate those committed by Dyer , who has wished to baptise his churches with the blood of young victims . Dyer thinks of himself as " a stranger to mankind " ; his life is led apart , " in a Corner " . He has grown up as one of " the orphans of the plague " who roam the streets of the city in the aftermath of the plague and of the fire that followed it . The romantic equation of orphan and monster makes a Satanist of this forlorn Dyer : " nor can we but by doing Evil avoid the rage of evil Spirits . " His is a theology in which Adam is unredeemed , and life itself a plague . London is a necropolis , its every corner the site of a murder , its soil a pudding of blood and tears . Out of this soil soar elegant churches , each of which encodes the symbols of an alien religion . The St So-and-So 's which Dyer has been commissioned to build are so many secret temples of Moloch . The experiments , proofs and improvements espoused by such scientists as Christopher Wren , Dyer 's patron in the building trade , Dyer pisses on . The homicides and postmortems in the book permit the new religion of science to exercise its power : but they also occasion the necrophile broodings which exude from Dyer . Much of this material -- this archaic London , the Hawksmoor churches , their magical meaning , and the tramps who haunt them -- comes from the striking poem Lud Heat by Iain Sinclair , where the churches are taken to be geometrically interrelated in the form of a pentacle , the sorcerer 's five-pointed star . The poem is dark , dense and learned -- Yeatsian , and maybe also Yatesian , in inspiration , amid much else . It is hard to be sure how much of this dark stuff Sinclair believes -- as it is hard to be sure how much Eliot believed of the lore which accompanies the dark stuff of The Waste Land , another London poem . The two poems could be thought to occupy a common ground which goes some way beyond topography , and includes a stretch of the common ground occupied by imitation . Sinclair 's , at all events , is the work of a Modernist , and is unlikely to be that of an occultist . This makes it , in a sense , compatible with Hawksmoor . But Hawksmoor is a different beast . The novel suggests itself as the work of a novelist intent on a gruesome entertainment . Both works , however , may be thought to share a secret , and a set of clues , which bear witness to the recrudescence of a hippy magic . Peter Ackroyd is all of the formidable pasticheur that he is praised for being , and Dyer 's tale , which affects to be that of someone who lived in the eighteenth century , and in which the element of imitation , present in writing of every kind , is more obtrusive than it is in the other tale , is the livelier of the two . Pastiche is a dualistic activity , and it is an activity which can lend itself to the expression of paranoid feelings and unacted desires . A writer is copied by " someone other " than himself , and that " someone other " can in a manner of speaking become the writer he copies : the biter bit . The expression I am quoting is uttered by Dyer , and it is an expression which Ackroyd is given to using in his books . In pretending here to be someone other than himself who keeps murdering people , he does a tremendous job : this is a more than serviceable argot for the age in question and for the wizard in question . The suffering and self-conscious first-person singular manifested in Dyer could be considered a creation of the Gothic novel that came after him , and Dyer can also bring to mind the magus of a time before . But there is no nagging sense of anachronism . How could there be ? the novel seems to be saying . There is no such thing as anachronism . All ages are one . The later stranglings look like a copy of what happened , at the hands of a sorcerer , in the loamy past , and Peter Ackroyd is very interested in copies . As is usual in such cases , the copy is not exact . Dyer 's doings are the same as but also different from those investigated by the fretful man he resembles , just as Hawksmoor 's investigative Scotland Yard is the same as but also different from the architects ' department of that name attended by Dyer . Ackroyd has given some readers the impression that the modern narrative , the paler of the two , is paler on purpose -- in obedience , presumably , to the doctrine of time , of its runnings-down and recurrences , which figures in the novel . The pale Hawksmoor is an inhabitant of the present day who reminds one not only of Dyer but of P. D. James 's character Inspector Dalgliesh -- one of her novels , A Taste for Death , published a few months after Hawksmoor , has a church murder in London , draped in the poses of this sensitive , cultivated policeman , and it also has , like Hawksmoor , a suspected tramp . Both inspectors are presented as more interesting than the colleagues and suspects they move among . With the James , we are told who did it ; in the Ackroyd , the matted fellow who is the chief suspect is never very securely identified as the author of the crimes -- it is almost as if the inspector could have done it : so that Ackroyd 's is an authorially uncertain work in which the authorship of its crimes is uncertain too . Meanwhile the interesting Hawksmoor is less interesting than Dyer , and may be meant to be . " Time will tell , sir " , a colleague remarks , and Hawksmoor replies : " Time will not tell . Time never tells . " Once more he raised his arm involuntarily , as if in greeting . " It is hard to think that the novelist intended the reader to find this even more gnomic and exasperating than the colleague seems to find it . But there may indeed be some such aim . Can the author be detected in this novel -- come upon in his dark corner ? The attitude to time might tell us what he thinks , but it is the most inscrutable aspect of the novel . Hora e sempre -- this motto is inscribed on the front of Hawksmoor 's , the real Hawksmoor 's , Classical house at Easton Neston in Northamptonshire : Easton Neston has been reputed or imagined to be the original of Mansfield Park , which may be described as a house imagined by an opponent of the Gothic novel . The motto refers to a dynastic permanence ; but it could be stolen for this novel , where a " now and always " is on show . We may be meant to think that time is simultaneous , in a way that may owe something to the simultaneity propounded , " perhaps " , in Eliot 's Four Quartets , where " History is now and England " ; or that it is cyclical , a turning wheel , with human depravity paling into insignificance as the wheel turns into modern times . Interpretation is allowed to copy what it finds , and to distort it , and it may be that the novel can be interpreted as an entertainment which conveys that doctrines of science and improvement ca n't encompass what happens in a frightening world , where motive is dark and ill-will ubiquitous . The Gothic novel was shaped to take account of such a world , and to do so , very often , in the guise of entertainment . Since its arrival in the eighteenth century , this is a literary mode which has recurrently been pronounced dead but which has been capable of renewal , and now Ackroyd has given a further turn to the wheel . Once again , a sufferer is seen to be mad , and his fearful sense of what he is up to can be seen to dominate the book in which it is in the end defeated or controverted . Such a book has to be divided -- between hope and fear , improvement and depravity . It will be the work both of one hand and of the other . And one of these hands may wield the instrument of pastiche . Hawksmoor , which came out in 1985 , was preceded by the Eliot biography of 1984 , which was preceded by The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde of the year before , and in 1987 these annual events were pressed upon by Chatterton . All four books reveal a steady concern with imitation and interpretation , and to read them together is to be clearer about what it is that the writer intends us to think that he thinks about things . He would appear to believe in an invented truth , an invented reality -- a Rortyan reality , one might be inclined to call it at times . He believes that a writer will often find himself through exposure to some other writer . And it is apparent that Ackroyd has found himself in this manner -- through exposure to Wilde , Eliot , and now Chatterton . This brings with it the corollary that it is not always apparent whether the beliefs he expresses are Ackroyd 's or those of the writer to whom he is exposed , or both . Interpreters must therefore beware , a little , in doing what they are generally allowed to do . All four books speak of a " someone other " . In Hawksmoor Ned the tramp encounters a " someone other " in his double , and in Chatterton Charles Wychwood 's double is another " someone other " . Eliot was able to " recognise himself through someone other " -- a changeable other , but at one point it was the Frenchman Laforgue . " The first law of the imagination " , states Ackroyd 's Wilde , is that " in his work the artist is someone other than himself . " Greek love is virtuous , Wilde is also represented as saying , because " men can live in perfect equality , each finding in the other the image of his own soul " . It is plain that there are many ways of being and of imagining a someone other . Art may imagine one , and Greek love may . Paranoia imagines one , and so does pastiche . And Ackroyd comes to vivid life as a pasticheur . " The truest Plagiarism is the truest Poetry " , claims Thomas Chatterton , warming to Ackroyd 's theme , and perhaps overdoing it , along with Ackroyd 's Wilde , who had been able to believe that " almost all the methods and conventions of art and life found their highest expression in parody " . Still , such claims do seem to have force when fitted to the case of the writer who is making or mediating them . Ackroyd 's truest prose occurs when he applies himself to the imitation of ancient and recent writers -- a repertoire of others . This , of course , is what Chatterton , Wordsworth 's " marvellous boy " , did in the plagiaristic eighteenth century . Like Chatterton , Peter Ackroyd is , in the words of his novel about Chatterton a " great Parodist " , a " great Plagiarist " . It is deemed to follow from such claims that human history is " a succession of interpretations " , a piling-up of imitations , an accumulation of metaphor which will be perceived as reality . And literature will amount to the same thing : all writers are copycats . Those who prefer to believe in an indivisible single self capable of originality will be sceptical of the Ackroyd scepticism . They will make less than he does of that part of Eliot which was a " good ventriloquist " . And they will undoubtedly object to the more unbridled formulations that enter the three fictions ; the biography of Eliot has plenty to say on the subject , too , while maintaining a comparative , and suitable , reserve . They wo n't accept with Charles Wychwood that " everything is copied " , and wo n't accept his opinion of Chatterton : " Thomas Chatterton believed that he could explain the entire material and spiritual world in terms of imitation and forgery , and so sure was he of his own genius that he allowed it to flourish under other names . " The second half of this can be seen to coincide with the opinion of Chatterton which is expressed by Ackroyd 's Wilde : " a strange , slight boy who was so prodigal of his genius that he attached the names of others to it . " Peter Ackroyd has here performed the not impossible feat of plagiarising himself -- while leaving the reader in doubt as to whether the writer shares this implausible estimate of Chatterton 's marvellous buoyancy . As Ackroyd 's ventriloquised Wilde makes clear , Wilde was a great exaggerator and , like his friend Whitman , a great contradictor of himself ; and he is certainly a great source of dualistic formulations , in all their slippery bliss . He is the artist 's friend , and a friend of the mimic and poseur , in a world of masks , multiplicities , contraries and successive interpretations . The Wilde apocrypha contains a joke which says it all -- or a fair part of it . Some good thing had been voiced , and Wilde had remarked that he wished that he had said it -- and was then told : . " You will , Oscar , you will . " The Marquis of Queensberry may be judged , in this context , to have made an involuntary and uncharacteristic joke in accusing Wilde of " posing as a somdomite " : a phrase that smells of the multiple self , and of the uncertainty of interpretation -- and indeed spelling ( Ackroyd , as it happens , interprets him as something other than a sodomite ) . Ackroyd 's Wilde complains of the " sordid " interpretations of his conduct which had influenced the outcome of his trial , while himself , on other occasions , interpreting his conduct as sordid . He also confounds his own dualistic zeal by recalling the wise words ( as one may truly think them ) of the dualistic mage Paracelsus : " Be not another , if thou canst be thyself . " In the literature of duality it is the outcast or victim who has dealings with a double , and in the second of the two novels Charles Wychwood is an outcast whose condition copies that of Thomas Chatterton , who committed suicide in 1770 at the age of 17 , having invented a medieval monk , Rowley , and written poems for him . Romantic poets were keen to vindicate Chatterton , and to cherish his untimely death as that of a sacrificial victim : here was a spilling of young blood that might have watered the purlieus of a church . Charles belongs , moreover , to a cast of outcasts , monsters , hustlers and impostors which composes a literary London reminiscent of the early novels of Muriel Spark , and far from brutally inauthentic . The queen of the authors is Harriet Scrope , novelist , plot-stealer , and ferocious egotist , whose war against the world she inhabits extends to her best friend and her cat . As a comic portrait of the artist , Harriet scores high . She is estranged and she is hostile . She is a bit like Dyer . " Tho " I was young Thomas Chatterton to those I met , I was a very Proteus to those who read my Works ' : Chatterton 's story is mostly told by himself , and with a felicity of cadence and of reference which can be caught in the sentence I have just quoted . His story is interwoven with , and is replicated by , a modern tale , in which Charles Wychwood 's comet-like career is featured . He too , dies the early death of romance -- en po�te , as the poet Burns put it with reference to his own fate -- and his end is enveloped in the consequences of his supposing that he has lit upon some Chatterton manuscripts . Charles is touchingly done -- a frail unpublished poet kept going by his wife and son ( the wife is called Vivien , presumably by design , though she is no copy of the first Mrs Eliot ) , their household a breath of fresh air in the conniving , phrase-making milieu to which Charles clings . Then there is a third story . Chatterton is as much as anything the famous painting of his death in a Holborn attic done in the 1850s by Henry Wallis -- with the poet lying across the bed in a kind of frozen entrechat . It looks like an enlargement of the postcard which , in an age of mechanical reproduction , it was to become , commemorating the tourist attraction which it was also to become . The third narrative tells how George Meredith modelled for the corpse in the painting and how his wife then ran away with the painter ( see also the sonnets in Meredith 's Modern Love ) . The three tales are deftly assembled and get on very well together . Chatterton is represented in the novel as an accidental suicide -- slain by a cocktail of arsenic and laudanum swallowed for a venereal infection . Poor Charles brings him to life again , however , for some further plagiarisms : a nest of antique-dealers , of antic disposition , in Chatterton 's native Bristol , have passed to Charles a cache of papers which , together with the discovery of what seems to be the portrait of an adult Chatterton , persuades him that the poet lived on . The portraits of Chatterton have something of the importance to the novel that the living and ageing likeness has in The Picture of Dorian Gray . Like Hawksmoor and The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde , this novel is a tour de force . And it could be said that not only is it about imitation -- it is also , as are other tours de force , itself an imitation of something . Like other tours de force , it is done in a spirit of play and of emulation . It is a contender : a colleague of Ackroyd 's on The Times announced that it was a " sure contender " for the Booker Prize of 1987 ( which it did n't receive ) . It observes one of Wilde 's principles of literature in responding to the importance of not being " serious " . It shows what the writer can do rather than what he thinks . In order to find out more of what this writer thinks about imitation , we are in a position to consult a work by him where a treatise on the subject is developed at intervals and where he writes in propria persona . In Ackroyd 's life of Eliot we read about a major poet who was a good ventriloquist ; a man of multiple personality who swore by a principle of impersonality in art which he was later to unswear by locating The Waste Land in the stresses of a domestic life , and whose art bears the indelible signature of that distinctive protean character of his ; a man who was often miserable and tormented . The book says that Eliot 's truest poetry was a form of plagiarism , in the benign sense that " it was only in response to other poetry that Eliot could express his own deepest feelings " . A little earlier , a view of Eliot 's has been paraphrased : that " there is no " truth " to be found " in the world , " only a number of styles and interpretations -- one laid upon the other in an endless and apparently meaningless process " . Ackroyd notices that the Eliot who had once called poetry a " mug 's game " was eventually , in his play The Elder Statesman , to use the same expression for forgery . Ackroyd warns us not to jump to a conflation here , but he is intrigued by the coincidence , and it might almost serve as an emblem of his concern throughout the biography with the connection between poetry and feigning , and with the potency of parody . The biography suggests that Eliot was never to lose the divided sense of his youth that human life is futile and meaningless -- that man is " a finite piece of reasonable misery " , in the words of William Drummond of Hawthornden , a good poet who was also a great plagiarist , and a great seeker of shelter in books -- but that an eternal order might be felt for , or invented . That order was eventually discovered in the teachings of Christianity . When he turned to God it was to someone other : he was surrendering to " something outside oneself " . The book depicts Eliot as a parodist , a plagiarist , a responder to other people 's poems , and as a seeker of shelter . And yet in its closing passages we learn that as a poet he had " no real predecessors " . He was his own man , after all . The book is cursory in its treatment of Eliot 's literary background : there is no mention , for instance , of Wallace Stevens , Ivy Compton-Burnett , of Empson or Leavis , and no adequate picture of what Eliot meant to later generations of intellectuals in Britain . In other respects , however , this is a cogent and sensible account ( which was constrained by a barbarous embargo on quotation ) . I do n't think that its readers can have had much trouble in finding in the life and work the responsiveness Ackroyd finds in them . But perhaps it is the paradox conveyed by that closing glimpse of a parodic but unprecedented Eliot which carries the sharpest conviction of any feature of the book . Eliot comes across as the sad man who sees double , as a living embodiment of the proposition that the double has to do with pain and with relief from pain , with the search , in such circumstances , for someone other . From the ordeal of his first marriage to the late happiness of the second , the book locks , at one level , into a recital of misfortunes and a medical record . Influenza after influenza . Constant debilitating " work " , in publishing and public life , and a constant invocation of the claims of such work . Lecture after lecture , accompanied by complaints about the futility of lectures and his reluctance to give them . The book makes one conscious of Eliot in the sarcophagus of his upper-class eminence ; of a sad face of clerical cut -- once the face of a delightful shy child -- bleakly sprouting from a sartorial apparatus that resembles the mourning clothes of a cabinet minister ; of a masterly poseur , an honoured invalid and recluse , of someone snobbish and sometimes selfish and inhumane , who sought relief in literature and in imitation , and who also embodied the opposite of these qualities . It is almost as if we are confronted here by a replication of the poor Tom described in Ackroyd 's novel by another poor Tom of later times . And perhaps we might imagine that they are the same but different . Eliot was to tell the poet F. T. Prince : " Not everything you write is very interesting . " This could be said with some emphasis of Chatterton , but not of Eliot himself , who moreover survived , who grew to be famous , who did not kill himself , though he was to wonder how one might set about dying . Chatterton died the romantic and traditional early death of the divided , the invaded man , while Eliot did not . It is n't that Ackroyd asks us to compare these two poor Toms , in pursuit of a theory alleging the importance of imitation . But they are brought together , in successive books , by the force of this preoccupation , and the reader has to make what he can of the resemblance between two figures quite remote from one another in any coarser understanding of the matter , to do this while adjusting his sight to a vista of copycats , impostors and successive interpretations -- a vista which is far from unfamiliar now and can be caught , for instance , in the productions and reproductions of contemporary literary theory . Imposture is shown in Ackroyd 's novel , in this burlesque of the literary life , to be an interesting business , but it is unlikely to cause Chatterton 's reputation to inch back towards what it was in the retrospects of the Romantic period . He was worshipped then for his talent and untimely death -- perhaps a little as Eliot was to be worshipped , in the 1940s and '50s , for his saintly abstention from the world . Keats placed him among the stars , where Keats himself , for similar reasons , was to be placed by Shelley . Chatterton became a topos , and the numbers lisped : " O Chatterton , how very sad thy fate " , " Flow gently , sweet Chatterton " , " Good for you , Chatterton " . Readers can be expected to spot which of these quotations are forgeries , and they must also have doubted in their time whether this writer was as good as the early tributes made out . It seems clear , however , that Chatterton need n't have had prodigious talent for the talent expended in the novel to take effect . It is a novel which communicates the notion that talented and untalented meet in that country of the mind where everyone copies and steals from everyone else , where everything is reproductive or reminiscent of everything else , where one thing leads to another and this person passes into that . It plays with such ideas , to a Shavian pitch of exaggeration : but it is not a novel of ideas , any more than it is a heartless game . It has people in it , with lives to live . It has Charles in it , whose plight is more touching than anything in the nineteenth-century retrospects of Chatterton . It has its predecessors in the romantic tradition -- a tradition which includes the self-important single self nevertheless prone to dispersal and division , invasion and impersonation , which includes the victim and his alter ego . At the same time , both here and in Hawksmoor , Ackroyd , too , is his own man . For all his standard procedures , I do n't think he is actually imitating anybody . Ariel goes to the police REVOLUTION , literature and love , and the roads and side-roads which join them together , are concerns which join together the Czech writers Milan Kundera and Ivan Klima , whose name is used by Kundera for the uxorious philanderer of his novel The Farewell Party . They are writers who have parted company , but who are in some ways at one . There is a sense in which the hero of Kundera 's novel Life is elsewhere , published in Britain in 1986 , is also the hero of Klima 's collection of stories My First Loves , published here in the same month of the same year . These are portraits of the artist who grows up in an age of revolutionary socialism and who has to make what he can of it . Revolution , and its betrayal by a regime which both prescribes and proscribes literature , are described in both works . Both men are interested in the subject of remembering and forgetting . In the books they write , music is heard in country places -- trumpets , fiddles , the cimbalom -- and love shows its face in country hotels , pleasant places , set down beside a stretch of water . Klima may perhaps be a common name in Czechoslovakia , and Kundera has become a common name in the conversation of Western readers , who are drawn to these reciprocal concerns of his . In the days before glasnost -- which his fictions may be thought to have rehearsed and predicted , but which could well mean that his fictions will no longer be for the West what they have been so far , when the thing that they deplore was still there in its entirety to be deplored -- Kundera was forced into exile in the " free world " of the time . So far , the free world has liked him both for having been , and for having ceased to be , a communist of a sort , for the freedoms he seeks in matters of literary form , for the modern inventiveness and manipulation of the literary games he plays , games that none the less commemorate , as he acknowledges , Cervantes , Sterne and Diderot , and for the sexual games which he plays in an age when , as he once put it , sexuality has ceased to be taboo . We have liked him for being into free speech and free love , and for what he has to say about convergences of the two , and about the curbs which revolution and its regimes has placed on them . The West has been grateful to Kundera , extravagantly so at times , and has shown an impulse to beat itself with his playful fictions . Heads have been turned , and have begun to swim , amid the flow of invention , delivered in works which have been Englished in rapid succession and which are not always easy to tell apart . Which is the one that has litost -- a form of self-pity -- and what does he mean by " unbearable lightness of being " ? Which of these two conceptions , for that matter , we may even sometimes wonder , is which ? But it seems safe to say that there are circumstances in which litost and glasnost can be recognised as enemies , and that this enmity can be recognised in the novel Life is elsewhere . His fertility , narrative gift , gift for experiments and impromptus , are such as to bewilder the attempt to form a judgement of any particular work . Not that he can mind that . What he does seem to mind -- and what even the most arbitrary-seeming , the most ludic , of his ironic and erotic diversions and excursions show that he minds -- is the regime that came to power in his native country after the revolution of 1948 . Many of his most memorable literary effects attest to this . In The Unbearable Lightness of Being , the Czech exile Sabina disturbs her French friends by being unable to last out a parade held to protest against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 : " She would have liked to tell them that behind Communism , Fascism , behind all occupations and invasions lurks a more basic , pervasive evil and that the image of that evil was a parade of people marching by with raised fists and shouting identical syllables in unison . " The British reader , who is likely to have been spared certain of the varieties of suffering which are spoken of in the writings of Kundera and Klima , where a joke , or no joke , or nothing whatever , can sequester you for years from the people you grew up with , is in a position , for all that , to know what Sabina means here . The British reader has only to listen to the sounds that protest makes in his own streets , to the cruel , brutal voices that bellow over loudhailers about injustice and the disadvantaged . In thinking about what Stalinism brought to his country , Kundera thinks of the support this despotism has received from the writers of his country , and of other countries . Literature , with its store of memories , is suspected by the state : and yet the state is served by certain writers . In books and interviews he has reminded the world that the French Surrealist poet Aragon , having praised Kundera 's excellent novel The Joke in 1968 , and having fulminated against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia -- his legs would " refuse " to take him to Russia any more -- made it to Moscow four years later ; and that another French poet , Eluard , abandoned his Prague friend , the Surrealist Kalandra , to the executioner . Nowadays , people all over the world unequivocally reject the idea of gulags , yet they are still willing to let themselves be hypnotised by totalitarian poesy and to march to new gulags to the tune of the same lyrical song piped by Eluard when he soared over Prague like the great archangel of the lyre , while the smoke of Kalandra 's body rose to the sky from the crematory chimney . Tyranny is a force which locks writers up and which self-serving lyrical writers may assist . Eluard 's soaring " lyricism " helped to perpetuate a tyranny , and is the kind of thing which led Kundera to employ the title The Lyric Age for the work which first came to him in the mid-Fifties , and which his publishers prevailed on him to retitle Life is elsewhere when it was completed in 1969 . It was published in America in 1974 , translated by Peter Kussi , who has revised his translation for the new edition of 1986 which I am discussing here . The provisional title referred to the life-span of Jaromil , who dies young , as lyric poets will , but also to the enforced , mass-produced , writer-proclaimed revolutionary ardours which ensued in 1948 . At the outset , Jaromil 's lyricism is a Modern affair in which biological compulsion and biographical reference -- peeps at the maid Magda in her bath , for instance -- are enveloped and disguised in a poetry which his doting and self-pitying mother finds inscrutable . His first loves -- to make use of Klima 's title -- prove to be his last , but prove as engrossing to him as the lyrics in which his emotional development is encoded . Jaromil is not so much a character as a type , and is not unlike the Shelleyan poet in Shaw 's Candida , Eugene Marchbanks . Aerial creatures , these , ineffectual angels . Eugene , " so uncommon as to be almost unearthly " , wants to go " up into the sky " . His brow is " lined with pity " . He speaks with " lyric rapture " . But he is all right when you get to know him . " Do n't say that Jaromil is a bad poet ! " Kundera 's 1986 Postscript implores . He is a " sensitive young man " -- a monster too , but the same monster is in you and me . And the same monster was in Shelley , and Rimbaud , and Victor Hugo . Jaromil and his mother are portrayed , we learn from the Postscript , quite without any satirical intention . In that respect , Kundera could have fooled at least one of his readers ; but I do see that it belongs to the point of it all that the uncommon Jaromil should be thought humanly representative . By a painter who befriends him , and who sleeps for a while with his mother , Jaromil , already self-perceived as exceptional , original , is introduced to modern art , which " had not yet become the shopworn property of the bourgeois masses and retained the fascinating aura of a sect , a magical exclusivity fascinating to childhood -- an age always daydreaming about the romanticism of secret societies , fraternities and tribes " . Soon he is writing modern poems . " This verse described a boy who had been trembling in front of the bathroom door , but at the same time this boy was swallowed up by the verse ; it surmounted and survived him . Alas , my aquatic love , said another line , and Jaromil knew that the aquatic love was Magda ; but he also knew that nobody else could find her in that line ... " . These lines are short and do not rhyme . They are free . Magda was lost in a poem which was " as independent and unintelligible as reality itself . Reality does not discuss , it simply is . The independence of the poem provided Jaromil with a marvellous world of concealment , the possibility of a second existence . " Jaromil has discovered that writing can be what reading has familiarly been for the ordinary person : an escape , a shelter , a door to the alternative self . Much later we read : Everything seemed to indicate that Jaromil 's enormous yearning for newness ( the religion of the New ) was only the disguised longing of a virginal youth for the unimaginable experience of the sex act . When he first reached the blissful shore of the redhead 's body , a peculiar idea occurred to him : he now knew at last what it meant to be absolutely modern ; it meant to lie on the shore of the redhead 's body . By now he has also reached " the realm of real life " -- by which he " understood a whirling world of parading throngs , physical love and revolutionary slogans " . It turns out that real life rhymes , that the revolution wishes its poetry to do so . There is a magical power in rhyme and rhythm . " Can a revolution dispense with repeated affirmation of the new order ? Can a revolution dispense with rhyme ? " By now free verse has been exposed as decadent , and modern art as the shopworn property of the bourgeois masses . Lyricism , then , is the poetry which sings along with the triumph of the proletariat , and with the repressions which accompany its triumph . What is required is a poetry which does not analyse or criticise , and is suitable for throngs and parades : we are in a situation where the self-portraits of the lyric author can be displayed like placards . Lyricism is inexperience , and it is the desire for glory . Such poems " need not be stimulated by real-life events " such as the plight of the Marseilles dock-workers , which has effaced the sight -- darkly limned in Jaromil 's juvenilia -- of Magda in her bath ; and if the poet who displays his ignorant , indifferent self-portrait is hoping for applause , there is a chance for him to do well in the new world of revolution , which rings with applause , and with blame . By the end of the novel Jaromil has forsworn his artist friend , who is under the ban of the regime and compelled to paint by candlelight : " The whole world of his pictures has been dead for years . Real life is elsewhere ! " We are told that these last four words are Rimbaud 's and the Surrealist Andr� Breton 's , and that in 1968 they were a slogan of the protesting Sorbonne students . They are words that can be made to mean different things , and are applicable as such to the story of Jaromil 's poetic progress from private to public , which can also be recognised as a simultaneity of the two , based on an enduring self-engrossment . Kundera asks us to join together two things that are often kept apart : lyrical effusions and public poetry . The quoted words point back to the privileged second existence which poetry had once promised Jaromil , and they point ahead : the old meaning has been reversed , with the claim that real life resides in a revolutionary solidarity . Just before this snarl about real life , he has betrayed his redhead to the police , by swallowing a lying excuse of hers concerning a subversive brother . The poets Czeslaw Milosz and Donald Davie have been bothered by the insufficiency and irresponsibility of the lyric genre , and it could be felt that Kundera goes further than they do in denouncing the lyric , and fares worse . The lyricism that sells out to a state-ordained reality and solidarity is not the only lyricism we know , and it is the opposite of much of what we know by that name . Youthful as some of them are , the lyrics of Heaney do not embody the genius of inexperience , whatever some of Shelley 's may do . In other words , Kundera 's novel isolates certain tendencies in the behaviour of poets ( and others ) in order to prosecute an attack on Stalinist Czechoslovakia . It will be clear to most people here that the attack is deserved , and that writers sold out . Jaromil 's adventures , moreover , are shrewdly observed . Lyricism can indeed be very like this description of it . Poetry has often been a form of self-pity and a means of self-advancement , and it has often pretended otherwise : Kundera 's book rumbles such pretence , as in the comedy he stages of an embassy of poets to a college of policemen and a debate there about the aesthetic of the socialist love-poem . But he does all this at the cost of suspending a due sense of the tendency there has also been for poets to see further than their noses , and to speak out , and to go to the wall for it . His Postscript evokes the aim of a white-coated Doctor Kundera " to solve an aesthetic problem : how to write a novel which would be a " critique of poetry " and yet at the same time would itself be poetry " . This aim has a sweepingness and a suspendingness which are apparent , too , in the novel to which it relates . Many poems contain a critique of poetry , just as many contain a critique of the self-portrayed poet , and of his intention to serve a social or doctrinal system , or of his claim to be a special case . The lyric is not generically debarred from standing out against the state , or from taking a generous interest in what goes on in the world . Mandelstam 's lyric about the " Kremlin mountaineer " -- Klima 's " great Generalissimo " , Stalin -- sent him to the camps . Ivan Klima could be called a lyric author , and the notion of what it is to be such an author is examined in My First Loves , whose gentle and deliberate stories read as if they have been grown and stored before being made public . The boy poet Klima loves literature , and pities himself , in a work which pities those around him . There is a lot to pity them for -- the stories touch on ghetto hardships , on murders and deportations . His father , devoutly socialist , is jailed by the socialist regime whose discipline replaces that of the SS . Klima 's first loves have a way of not working out ; and what may have been his longest affair is the one about which least is said . In the opening story Miriam distributes milk to the tenement building and favours the boy with an extra helping : but he never gets to tell her that he is the lyric author of poems " about love . About suicide . " The second story is set in and around a country hotel , where the wife of a coarse doctor takes a more than kindly interest in a Klima wide-awake to the sights and sounds of this paradise . The story ends at a funeral , hovered over by a surreal balloon , from which hangs a fancied female acrobat . The boy 's hand is squeezed by the weeping wife . He is in two minds . " I was able to soar up , to fly , I could rock in the air like that balloon , I could fly away with it , choose any of the four points of the compass , but I remained where I was , I stopped above this small , painful , blessed piece of earth . " Then there is the tale of a lying girl , as she may be , with whom he makes love , and who alarms him with word of a threatening German -- a former SS man , perhaps . He has her report the matter to the police . This is a lapse on his part , but is hardly comparable with Jaromil 's treatment of his mendacious redhead . Klima 's girl disappears into the Prague bars , leaving him with an imaginary address . She is rather like a lyric author herself , a bit of a lyre . The last story has to do with the girlfriend of a friend . Literary , second-sighted , sick , she holds out a hand to him : he clasps it , but then decides he ca n't go on . Is Klima , as the angry friend alleges on this occasion , a flirt , who goes from girl to girl ? The stories do well to return an uncertain answer . Through them , somewhat in the spirit of Chagall , runs the aerial preoccupation of romantic escapism . Balloons float , a high-wire circus act teeters . In the last story Klima comes to see " the connection between heights and vertigo , ecstasy and ruin , soaring and falling " . The literary girl waxes lyrical . A person who accepted love was like a passenger . Maybe on a boat , at night , on some vast lake . Whichever way you looked there was nothing but calm black water . It was true that the water might rise and swamp you . But to love someone meant to fly , to rise above the earth yourself . So high that you could see everything . Even if the world looked different from that height , even if it looked changed , even if what on the ground seemed important was transformed into insignificance . She 'd say , moreover , that you could always get out of a boat and go ashore , but from that height you could only crash . The blessed piece of earth over which float these balloons , over which are poised these acrobats , is a corner of painful Czechoslovakia . Klima 's stories breathe a delicate patriotism -- which is not absent , either , from Kundera 's accounts of a country which is harder to inhabit , or remain in , or return to . For both men , Czechoslovakia is both painful and blissful . It is not surprising that the Czech novelist Josef Skvorecky should be keen on My First Loves . Skvorecky left his country to teach in North America -- as did the Dubcekite Klima -- and has improved the shining hours of a Canadian exile . But Klima has gone back . It has been said of him that he would rather live in his native country , and not be allowed to publish , than go elsewhere and be free to do so . Reality is in Czechoslovakia ? A challenging attitude on his part , if the story in question is correct . It should not persuade us that this writer has yielded or sold out , any more than it should persuade us that the boy poet Klima is in every sense the boy poet Jaromil . It is possible to suggest that the two poets resemble one another . Each is inexperienced , youthful . Each fancies a second existence , wants to float free . Each feels sorry for himself . Each is lyrical . But the lyricism of the character " Klima " can be considered an element in the lyricism of Ivan Klima , and be thought to encounter there its own critique . As for that business of going to the police , I am sorry I mentioned it . There is nothing in the stories to suggest that either of these lyrical Klimas has the makings of the hero of the state imagined by Kundera . Kapuschinski WE live at a time when reporters go to foreign countries where there is trouble and come back to write books in which they say that it was hard to make out what was going on . When they say this , they are apt to be called writers . Writers do n't know what is going on . But they can be good at conveying what it was like for them to be there , and to be writing it down . The journalists to whom I am referring can more solemnly be said to be practising a modern art of indirection , of the unintelligible and the interminable . It is as if the war , crisis , living hell or chaotic backwater can never be known and will never end . After a while you fly out . A leading exponent of these mysteries is the novelist and journalist V. S. Naipaul , whose foreign countries are , as we have already seen , areas of darkness , where coups and crises are glimpsed but may remain enigmatic . Another is Ryszard Kapuscinski , an expert in what he calls " confusion " , who has attended twenty-seven revolutions in the Third World . These revolutions , he believably reports , have been confusions . There he sat in his writer 's hotel room , venturing out into a series of tight corners , filing his copy , then leaving for Warsaw to compose his short books -- objects physically slight but charged with these confusions . They are marvellously done , and they have caused a stir of approval in this country , while also raising doubts . In the New Left Review , Benedict Anderson has made sharp criticisms of the work of the journalist and poet James Fenton which compare it with that of Kapuscinski and Naipaul . These three writers are tagged as representatives of two hardly very different types or crisis-fancying , Third Worldly literary tourist . Kapuscinski exercises a personal charm which must have helped him to establish friendly relations with the people he met , and to gather material , and which can seem to befriend the Western reader . Born in 1932 , he retired as a foreign correspondent for the Polish Press Agency in 1981 , by which time his three books had started to come out . They describe three falls : that of the Emperor Haile Selassie , that of the Shah and that of the colonial masters of Angola . No fall from power within the Eastern bloc of nations is mentioned in any of the books . The Ethiopian book , published in Britain in 1983 , showed him to be a writer interested in " autocrats " -- in absolute power and in the transformation of that power into its indistinguishable opposite . He says that it is " difficult to say when omnipotence becomes powerlessness " . Not that the stories of Haile Selassie and the Shah are any great advertisement for the omnipotence of omnipotence . Both rulers had reason to fear . Both of them , though , were rulers whom Western journalists used to admire : they were jewels in the crown of freedom , and yet endearingly autocratic . Kapuscinski 's first two books will serve to deter any cult of the dear dead kings in question . In The Emperor he writes : For the starvelings it had to suffice that His Munificent Highness personally attached the greatest importance to their fate , which was a very special kind of attachment , of an order higher than the highest . It provided the subjects with a soothing and uplifting hope that whenever there appeared in their lives an oppressive mischance , some tormenting difficulty , His Most Unrivalled Highness would hearten them -- by attaching the greatest importance to that mischance or difficulty . The Emperor has something of the technique of comic and fantastic exaggeration that we associate with Dickens , and something of the manner , too , of Dickens 's reader , Kafka : In the courtyard where the Emperor s retinue awaited him , there were tens , no , I say it without exaggeration , hundreds eager to push their faces forward . Face rubbed against face , the taller ones squelching down the shorter ones , the darker ones overshadowing the lighter ones . Face despised face , the older ones moving in front of the younger ones , the weaker ones giving way to the stronger ones . Face hated face , the common ones clashing with the noble ones , the grasping ones against the weaklings . Face crushed face , but even the humiliated ones , the ones pushed away , the third-raters and the defeated ones , even those -- from a certain distance imposed by the law of hierarchy , it 's true -- still moved toward the front , showing here and there from behind the first-rate , titled ones , if only as fragments : an ear , a piece of temple , a cheek or a jaw ... just to be closer to the Emperor 's eye ! It is not easy to know how far Kafka 's fictions can be thought to answer descriptively to the historical realities of his time , let alone to those which his fictions are often thought to have predicted . And it is not easy to know how far Kapuscinski 's book is a book about a bygone Ethiopia . Is it a book about Poland ? It purports to be based on the recollections of courtiers and retainers hunted up after the fall : but I have heard it suggested that the author did not take to the Picador edition 's cover display of a picture of Haile Selassie , perhaps on the grounds of a misleading particularity . The reader who believes he is learning things about Imperial Ethiopia may be equally inclined to tell himself that this is a country of the mind , constructed on principles not very different from those of the Samuel Johnson who devised , for the Abyssinia of Rasselas , just representations of general truths and of a common humanity . From Abyssinia Kapuscinski passed to Persia . From Rasselas , as it were , to Ozymandias . Present in the second book as the occupant of an Iranian hotel room sifting through his papers , photographs and cassettes , Kapuscinski recites the history of the region , which has thrust the Shah of Shahs into the sand in the posture of the statue of the " King of Kings " in Shelley 's tyrannophobe poem . The Shah had made a showplace of his country with his colossal purchasing of weapons , and look what it had all come to : " If you drive from Shiraz to Isfahan even today you 'll see hundreds of helicopters parked off to the right of the highway . Sand is gradually covering the inert machines . " Shortly after the point at which the recital ends , sand was to cover some more helicopters -- those sent by President Carter to liberate the American hostages seized in Teheran , where Kapuscinski catches a glimpse not of them but of their place of confinement . At this palace , as at the other , servility shows its face and performs its tricks . Foreign statesmen revere an oil-rich omnipotence : " Now the whole world was at his feet . Before him were bowed heads , inclined necks and outstretched hands . " Kapuscinski speaks of the liberals who lost out when the Shah was expelled , but Bakhtiar is not particularised . Bani Sadr he does mention , with sympathy . He says of the liberals that they were placed in a predicament by the fall : " A democracy can not be imposed by force , the majority must favour it , yet the majority wanted what Khomeini wanted -- an Islamic republic . " The suggestion that democracy can not be imposed by force has the force of a generalisation . Kapuscinski is a seeker of general truths who is sparing with his generalisations , and who likes certain kinds of particularity but not others . The kind he likes he calls " detail " , as opposed to " long shots " -- the equivalent , that is , of the long shots over-used by cameramen of the Iranian Revolution : " it is through details that everything can be shown " -- that truth can be shown . But in The Emperor no detail is adduced that might bring out what differences there could have been between the courtiers and petitioners of Ethiopia and their counterparts elsewhere in the world . Kapuscinski 's courtiers and petitioners are about as black as Johnson 's Prince Rasselas , who is about as black as he is white . In the second book , a photograph is spoken of which " shows the pulling down of a monument to one of the Shahs ( father or son ) in Teheran or some other Iranian city . It is hard to be sure about the year the photograph was taken , since the monuments of both Pahlavis were pulled down several times , whenever the occasion presented itself to the people . " Here the confusions or uncertainties are the point of the passage : it does n't matter that the particulars of the caption are missing since this sort of thing was always happening . It matters less and less as we move into an enjoyable account derived from a vocational puller-down of statues of the Shah and his father . The Shah was equal to these demolitions : " If we pulled one down , he set up three . " The wrecker explains that , one way or another , " it 's not easy to pull down monuments " . Kapuscinski then generalises . The Shah 's regime was a transplant that the system had rejected : " The rejection of a transplant -- once it begins , the process is irreversible . All it takes is for society to accept the conviction that the imposed form of existence does more harm than good . " I am not sure how much work these last words are doing , and if there is tautology here , it is compounded by what follows . Rejecting the Shah was A great experience , an adventure of the heart . Look at the people who are taking part in a revolt . They are stimulated , excited , ready to make sacrifices . At that moment they are living in a monothematic world limited to one thought : to attain the goal they are fighting for . Everything will be subjugated to that goal ... Kapuscinski 's way with words entails adding , repeating piling up , for the space of a slim volume . But the " and 's " and " or 's " and the more and more rarely irritate , and are triumphant in the great set-pieces which mean so much to all three books -- like that palimpsest of faces in Addis Ababa . In 1975 , the year after the fall of Haile Selassie , and four years before the fall of the Shah , the witness of revolutions turned up in Angola for the abandonment of their colony by the Portuguese : the subject of the third of these books of his . Agostinho Neto , politician and poet , the leader of the MPLA , is about to preside over the new state , but two enemy armies are converging on the capital , Luanda : the FNLA under Holden Roberto and Unita under Jonas Savimbi . All three have international sponsors , and Kapuscinski is to find out that the South Africans have invaded in the south of the country , having fallen in love with Savimbi . As in the earlier books , the bravura set-piece dominates , and the most memorable concerns the crates in which the Portuguese have packed up their belongings , and which were eventually shipped out of Africa -- Kapuscinski was to stumble on a few of them in Portugal , sunk , as it were , in the sand . He writes of them as they stay for waftage : Some crates were as big as vacation cottages , because a hierarchy of crate status had suddenly come into being . The richer the people , the bigger the crates they erected . Crates belonging to millionaires were impressive : beamed and lined with sailcloth , they had solid , elegant walls made of the most expensive grades of tropical wood , with the rings and knots cut and polished like antiques . The passage takes off thereafter in ecstatic inventory . At the start of the book there are false notes , those of a Hemingway war correspondent : " Every knock at the door could mean the end for me . I tried not to think about it , which is the only thing to do in such a situation . " But matters are mended with the arrival of the crates -- antiques that epitomised an antique land , brief monuments to the old Angola . Benguela , in the south , is one of Kapuscinski 's ghost towns . A deserted European quarter is twinned with an African settlement out in a desert " white and glimmering like a salt spill , without a blade of grass " . These Africans have not moved into the houses of the Portuguese . They are passive , we are told ; moral scruples do n't come into it . Kapuscinski generalises : " the degree of consciousness that drives one to demand justice or do something about obtaining it has n't yet been reached . " From Benguela , Kapuscinski and a film crew travel to a scene of carnage , guided by Carlotta , a heroine of the MPLA . When the Europeans decide to return , their guide decides to stay , and is immediately killed . " We are all culpable in Carlotta 's death , since we agreed to let her stay behind ; we could have ordered her to return . " A colonial " could " . Kapuscinski is soon in a still hairier place , further south , where he is told of the South African intervention . This is a scoop , and he fights his way back through wildernesses , road-blocks , threats of ambush , to inform Warsaw . The last Portuguese leave Luanda . Independence is declared , and Neto 's position as head of the hard-pressed MPLA improves . By now Kapuscinski is on his " last legs " , and he telexes Warsaw to say that he wants to leave and that it is " more or less clear " that " the Angolans will win " . Neto 's , and Castro 's , Angolans , presumably . On the following page we read that " things were going badly " for Neto . Since then , for the thirteen years since Kapuscinski 's departure , things have gone badly for the Angolans , and they are still suffering terribly . But at last , in the summer of 1988 , negotiations are in hand which may end the war . It is a war which has begun to embarrass the interveners . According to the Guardian , the New Year 's Honours list of 1988 in Britain contained a knighthood for " Professor Albert Maillard , the Oxford historian " . Two of the several names owned by another recipient had strayed into someone 's word-processor to create a further deserving don , the knowing reference to whom must have ruined the new year for more than one senior scholar . I feel that Albert Maillard , if he existed , would have no time for Kapuscinski 's impressionism , for his absence of dates , figures and state papers , and that Albert Maillard would be wrong . There is history in the accounts Kapuscinski gives of the confusions and uncertainties which he has experienced and which he has tried to interpret . All is not dark in these accounts , and indeed they can be said to gleam with a quality of reflected light . I think of him as an artist who writes history , and I take it that the history he writes includes the history he has principally suffered -- that of Poland . An autocrat falls in the first two books ; but the only one in the third is the author-autocrat of the hotel room who sallies into the bush , as if on impulse , to visit the mysterious , moveable " front " . At the same time , he is a shrewd observer who writes compellingly about the people and the landscapes he encounters . A benevolent despot . The same description would not , in my view , be grossly inapplicable to the present ruler of Poland -- which has , as it happens , a smaller population than the Ethiopia of chronic famine . General Jaruzelski bears no obvious resemblance to the Third World autocrats discussed in the first two books . But it can scarcely be in doubt that these books have in them home truths , and an ironic obliquity or duplicity , which richly relate to the world of Jaruzelski 's predecessors , and indeed to the experience of other countries where literature and opinion have been repressed . Their writing coincided with the rise of Solidarity . They are books which bring together all three of the worlds we inhabit , and they are books which appear to thrive on being seen through -- on the transparency of their suggestion that tyrannies , that sycophancy , conspiracy and repression , courts and courtiers , are all on the royal right , and in the bush , and running into the sand . Heroine of Our Time SUICIDE was thought damnable in the Middle Ages , and I expect there are those who have been brought to feel by a book called The Monument that the Middle Ages had a point . T. Behrens 's book commemorates a young couple who lived together for seventeen years in a solitude � deux and who then took their own lives -- incompetently and lingeringly . Representatives of the few people they had come to know in the course of their wanderings round the world were left to clear up . Suicide tends now to command sympathy , even when the reasons for it are hard to understand . Not everyone who reads the book will be able to sympathise with Justin and Ursula , or to believe that they understand them . But there will also be those who will stay with it for its relish of damnation . This is one of the many books which address the snobbery of the English , which flash at their readers the lawns of country houses , the baize of gambling-tables , which tell tales of those virtuosos of ostentation and disregard who have in common a contempt for commonness , for the middle class ; and it could be said of such books that their chief resource is the eccentricity which has long amounted to a convention of upper-class life . Literary careers can be founded on the impersonation and adulation of privileged behaviour ; but the literary works which have been written and inspired by English snobs and sports are by no means all boastful or complicit . The supreme text of recent years is James Fox 's account of Lord Lucan and his set , with their boffes de politesse . Patrician insolence has quite often appeared to express a perception of the activities of the levelling Labour governments which have come and gone since 1945 . Behrens 's book , however , pays no attention to politics or to public matters . His story begins at a time when , as at other times in this century , the patriciate , and the merely rich , had slipped down into marked collusion with the smart , with upstarts and bohemians . The well-born and the well-off have been apt at such times to turn , for diversion and instruction , to foreigners and to members of the working class . These strangers have been sexual , artistic . Theirs was the charm of not being bourgeois , and the foreigners among them could be , or could come across as , princes , pretenders to a throne , descendants of a khan . What survived , in the late Fifties , of the Chelsea set welcomed a refugee from Hungary , after the Soviet invasion of that country . This was Ursula of the long blonde hair and double-barrelled baronial-barbaric surname ( withheld by Behrens ) , who had fled what survived of ancestral estates -- on one view of the matter -- and had made her courageous way across Europe , shot at and winged by border guards , to Vienna , and on to London , where she fell among art historians and was counselled by Anthony Blunt . As did the author of the book , who is a painter and who was then at the Slade , she discovered , he tells us , that " the people with the beautiful faces were also , mysteriously , the ones it was most fun to be with " . The self-proclaimed " honesty " of the wild , well-born stranger was doubted , but her fascination prevailed . She married an art dealer , Kenelm , understood to be seriously ill , and conducted daring affairs , one of them on the Metro with her friend Monique 's friend Gianni : Gianni and Ursula leapt on just as the doors were closing , but Monique , who was now a few yards behind them and whose movements were hampered anyway by her arthritis , was left standing there as the train moved out . Ursula and Gianni got off at the next station but one , having brought their growing mutual admiration to a startling climax wedged solid among the rocking mass of sober commuters . After a quick tidy-up they took the next train back to the Gare de Lyon where Monique had only twenty minutes to wait . Were the other passengers all sober ? Startling the commuter is a game in which it is best to think so . Chapter Five opens with the information : " Ursula and Kenelm had known my parents for some time , having been introduced originally by a mutual friend . Kenelm had then sold my father a pair of eighteenth-century cupboards . " And so it was that Ursula met Justin , the writer 's moody adolescent brother , and ran away with him . Away ! They were off on their seventeen years of Tristan and Isolde . Justin , who would appear to have lost some of his old charisma , became the straight man of the act -- always mending things . They lived frugally but in style . They rented a flat in Rome and built a house in Greece . Here they are , unisex and colour-supplement-magnetic in an Italian " working-class " restaurant : " Justin and Ursula , with their measured dignity and impeccable , interchangeable clothes -- perhaps soft leather waistcoats over silk shirts and linen trousers in colours that rarely overstepped the narrow arc of the spectrum between cream and ochre -- were immediately noticeable . " They turned nomadic and mingled with the nomads of the Sudan , where they were to consider building a further house and perhaps settling down . They swam , they talked , they wrote their diaries and stories , and were at ease in a succession of remote and sticky places . Ursula 's bad back was religiously exposed to unmanageable African horses and jolting lorry rides . England 's wealthy and wonderful -- their scams and scrapes , their portfolios , clubs , night-clubs , champagne and cocaine , the Cockney accents of their young ones , their gossip-columnists and their art historians , their Lucan-like zombies and their zoos and safaris -- were avoided . T. Behrens kept up with the fleeing lovers , at intervals . He visited them in Egypt , accompanied by a girl he 'd met in a bar , who proved to be a lesbian . His own vicissitudes in love are a feature of the story he tells , as is his attempt to understand his disconcerting brother and to produce reflections on the meaning of it all . Ursula 's diary is reflective too , but is at its best in its evocations of place -- of the nothingness of the desert , especially . She can , against the odds , be funny : " Dinkas in the market have long , brass-bound pipes . One of these smokers wears a T-shirt with the words " ever ready " . He looks less ready than anyone I 've ever seen . " One of her sententious entries reads : " Tactlessness is often taken for sincerity , and sincerity is in turn often taken for a compliment . Let no one ever be sincere with me -- it is a failure of respect , and respect is a thing one can never get enough of . And the only kind of respect worth having is the insincere kind . " Another reads : " Where would we be without that much-maligned virtue , vanity ! " These upper-class pens�es lighten the load of an odyssey whose ports of call , for all her evocations , are barely distinguishable from one another . Struggling with his maps , the writer is forced into sheer itinerary : They drove directly south-west into Algeria through Guelma , Bou Saada , Ain Sefra , Colomb B�char near the Moroccan frontier , Tindouf , into Mauritania through Chinguetta , and reached the Atlantic coast at Nouakshott . Then down the coast to St Louis in Senegal . At Dakar they cut sharply back into Mauritania through Kiffa , then south again to Kayes in Mali . On to Bamako , then eastward into Upper Volta through Bobo Djoulasso and Ouagadougou . But this , too , is upper-class , this recital of exotic place-names -- so often the spoor of the doughty , ascetic , astringent English traveller who has left his privileges behind . As the years go by , Ursula 's body becomes a bore , and she experiences a fear of ageing : " I shall have to die fairly young , because I wo n't be able to live with the infirmities of old age . " She is indeed ready to die , and it is a difficulty that Justin may feel that he has to do the same . In the Sudan she declares : " My time is up . " She is infatuated with a handsome police chief , goes rather grimly to bed with him in the time he can spare from gambling sessions , and then kills herself . Justin goes back to England for a while , and then , having broken some hearts , arrives in the Sudan to perform his own suicide . They now lie together in a single lot in a local cemetery . The headstone is inscribed with the words : " Ursula and Justin -- One " . " One " was a word of the Chelsea set for the first person singular , and one might perhaps venture the thought of a pun in the words of the inscription . These two people had enacted what we have long been accustomed to think of as a romantic programme , whereby love and death converge , and dying young is the thing to do , whereby other people , and common life , are a thing to be escaped from , and a tension develops between the duty to a partner and a cultivation of the self , between the dictates of an amour fou and an amour de soi . " Most people addicted to romancing are their own heroes " : when a second person enters the solitude in question , Louisa Stuart 's maxim becomes harder to apply . But I have the impression that Ursula was very much her own heroine . T. Behrens is considerably baffled by this strange case , by the question of what it was that determined Ursula 's adherence to this programme , and of what it was that caused her to bring to an end her loving friendship with Justin . Guesses are hazarded , and are quoted from interviews he conducted . A hint of child abuse may seem to be imparted by his account of a Gothic moment which came about during a walk with her father , at nightfall , in a setting of peasants and forests . Ursula figures as " some sort of Hungarian countess " whose parents were estranged and who was to be estranged from her ominous father . There she once sat in some sort of castle , or not , reading , for sure , the literature of Romanticism , and growing up to resemble -- in the opinion of the writer 's aunt , the historian C. B. A. Behrens -- a character out of Lermontov . Lermontov , for his part , was a character out of Byron , and so was Pechorin , the " hero of our time " in Lermontov 's novel of 1839 , one of those people " who are fated to attract all kinds of unusual things " . Pechorin is a cold-hearted , stylish fatalist , experimentalist , existentialist and divided man , a traveller , gambler , heart-breaker and forgetter of old friends , who loves to ride " a spirited horse through the long grass against a desert wind " . Blond and beautiful in his leg-ribbons , his high-heeled shoes , " fitted with the greatest possible exactitude " , his " long white tunic " and " dark-brown Circassian coat " . Byron 's is not the only ghost to be detected here : the cold hearts of his precursors Lovelace and Laclos 's Valmont are present in Pechorin , who has succeeded in attracting a certain princess . I 'll tell you the whole truth , " I answered the Princess . " I wo n't excuse or explain my conduct . I do n't love you . " The colour faded from her lips . " Leave me alone , " she said , barely audibly . I shrugged my shoulders , turned , and walked away . The shrugger does n't care whether he lives or dies -- and the designer duel arranged for himself by this divided and indifferent man is a form of Russian roulette . The duel in which Lermontov was soon to die is said to have been patterned , so far as its arrangements went , on the one in the novel : the outcome , however , was perceptibly different . V. G. Kiernan 's recent book on the history of duelling -- the work of a historian who is able to grasp , as many historians now are not , that the literature of the past is evidence of the past -- discusses Lermontov 's real and imaginary duels . The book indicates that duelling and gambling have been co-ordinate activities : both , we may feel , are poised on a knife-edge between accident and intention . If there is an element of design on Pechorin 's part in the duel he fights , an element which incorporates a knowledge of the loaded dice to be employed by his opponent in the form of an unloaded pistol , the outcome can still be ascribed to chance , in a sense that must be meant to characterise the hero 's fine indifference . Kiernan reports suggestions that Lermontov 's own death ( like Pushkin 's in another duel a few months before ) may have been murder , a murder planned by court reactionaries . Outcomes are uncertain , games of chance can be rigged -- but this is not what we are conscious of in reading about Ursula . We read that she intended , in Hamlet 's words , to " leave betimes " , and that she did what she intended . That there was a pattern for her in Lermontov 's novel is conceivable : but it ca n't be claimed that it fits her with exactitude , or that it provides an explanation of her conduct . It is clear enough , none the less , that the hero of that time is like the hero of some other times , including Hamlet 's . Shakespeare 's play has an arranged duel which miscarries , and which takes off a divided , gambling man who has wondered whether or not it might be better to end his life . Here , too , the uncertainty of a duel utters the uncertainty of internal division . Those who pursue comparisons of the kind I am referring to are likely to be impressed by the staying-power of a literary preoccupation to which a variety of temperaments and compulsions has been attracted , and could well be inclined to believe that Pechorin 's duel and indifference may have been among the precedents that weighed , a century later , with a woman bent on contriving her appointment with destiny . Not much is made , however , in the book she has become , of the cultural provenance of this Russian-style belle dame sans merci . She is present in the book as narcissistic , driven and depressive , with the fascination of such people , as the enigma of an exceptional vitality drawn towards " laziness " and extinction , as a suicidal survivor , her life a chapter of escapes . But she was also , among other literary things , the wonderful and baleful orphan or isolate who is seen to advantage in the books she read : and it may be that cultural history is especially worth attending to in cases such as hers , where the subject is a dedicated reader , and the basis for a directly psychological account is even more than usually insecure . Not that T. Behrens sets up as a psychologist . To read about her here is like being shown someone 's snaps or scrapbook -- perhaps an underrated pleasure . It is like an evening spent in a restaurant -- let 's say Olwen 's French Club , mentioned on page one , a latter-day refuge of the Chelsea set -- listening to a story of mutual friends . And it is a trip in its own right , on the teller 's part . T. Behrens gives the impression that he has more to say about himself than the progress of this mad love -- to which he did not stand all that close at the time , brother as he was -- has allowed him to come up with . It is also possible to feel , and to be told in London , that there was more to be said about the mad love than he allowed himself , or was in a position , to come up with . And it may be that Justin , too , has more to say , from beyond the grave . Waiting in the wings is a book by him about Ursula , entitled Style , which , according to Graham Greene , who was sent the manuscript , could be edited for publication . There may be a cult in the making -- and one could imagine a film by Antonioni , whose script-writer , Mark Peploe , was intrigued by J. Behrens in his last days . Kingsley and the Woman A RECENT photograph of Kingsley Amis shows him with a cat , which is standing beside his typewriter . The author 's face wears a witch 's smile of appreciation . He is clearly familiar with and fond of that cat . The smile may have come as a surprise to connoisseurs of the pictures of him which have been issued to the world . These pictures , rarely cordial , have become more and more baleful : it is as if he is holding himself back from physical assault on a reader supposed to be a trendy and a lefty , which is , indeed , what many of his readers have always been . The smile contrasts , moreover , with the expression to be imagined on the face of the male lead , Patrick Standish , in Amis 's novel of 1988 , Difficulties with girls , when the cat in Patrick 's life pays him a visit . You feel at first that on a bad day ( there are quite a few ) Patrick might give it one of the kicks that the novelist seems about to direct at his readers . Then it turns out that Patrick rather likes it after all . But then it turns out that the female lead , his wife Jenny Standish ( n�e Bunn ) , unreservedly cherishes their cat . All this could suggest that Kingsley Amis is n't altogether sold on Patrick Standish . Readers of Amis can be expected to remember Patrick and Jenny from the past . They appeared in his novel of 1960 , Take a girl like you , in which Patrick gives freezing looks , and a group of children wears the " expression of being proud of being serious , like some famous author photographed in the Radio Times " . The new novel has married the pair and moved them on into the mid-Sixties and from the provinces to London , where Patrick works misgivingly in a fashionable publishing-house . And there are other reappearances from the earlier novel . Each of the novels has an alluring Wendy . Graham McClintoch of " the indefensible ginger-coloured suit " has returned , and there are commemorative mentions of a ginger this and a ginger that . Patrick is still having difficulties with girls : the married man keeps going to bed with them , not liking it very much and not liking the distress it brings to a wife whom he does like and who is carefully crafted to be likeable . I reviewed Take a girl like you when it came out , and took pains to convey how much I enjoyed and admired its incendiariness . The review seemed to think that the swinging Sixties contained a readership , among others , that would be shocked by the novel 's candour and scabrousness about sex -- " no doubt he has touched himself on the raw . He will touch everyone on the raw " -- while the young would receive it as an account of what they were up to . But it was clear , and is clearer still in retrospect , that on a number of occasions an old decorum had been deferred to , or embraced . Jenny 's Jack the Lad is addressed by her as " my lad " , and she firmly refuses to rush into bed with him . The narrator may not wholly be in jest when he refers to sexual intercourse with a certain girl , 17 or thereabouts , as " the ultimate indecorum " , and rereaders of the novel are likely to be mindful of the survival here of an old England lived in by people like the middle-aged T. S. Eliot , exponents of a disgusted chastity . It seems appropriate that the language of Four Quartets should enter the novel at one point -- appropriate , too , of course , that it should be mocked . So the piece was solicitous in trying to alleviate the shocks by explaining that the novelist himself was shocked . And I think it was right to argue that the book has its " strict disclaimers " and that goodness of heart , chiefly Jenny 's , is defensively displayed amid a welter of misconduct . There is a bleakness which centres on Patrick 's infidelities : but it may also be true that the rudeness and aggression with which Jenny , their sex object , is treated by various chuntering males has grown grimmer with the years than it was reckoned to be , by the author , by me and by many of his readers , at the time . The review predicted that " any eventual mating " between Patrick and Jenny " will have something permanently bitter and irresolute about it " . A linguistic point was made in the course of the review -- that Julian Ormerod 's lounge-bar slang is " continuous , in a way , with Patrick 's cool utterance " -- and the review also made out that Ormerod 's overdone good heart is continuous , in a way , with Jenny 's . " No wonder we like them " , said a poem of Amis 's once . The poem says that women are " much nicer than men " . But the novels were soon to exhibit an interest in misogyny , and to see a connection between " the old hoo-ha " and " the old last end " -- expressions used by Ormerod and Standish respectively , in Take a girl like you , for sexual intercourse and death . Thinking about women is a way of avoiding the thought of death -- and yet women may be the end of you . No wonder we fear them . A paranoid reproach is aimed at all females by an Amis-like figure , who then reproaches himself , or is reproached by some other Amis agent detectable in the novel . At times a golden girl is present in the vicinity of the discussions of the subject that keep happening , and is felt to restore a balance . Fairly early in Take a girl like you , Patrick delivers himself of an unqualified condemnation of women , which is followed by a sentence from the narrator concerning and presumably condemning Patrick 's attitude to Jenny at that stage , as a girl to be taken and left : " He wanted more than his share of her before anybody else had any . " These " Jenny-dealings " have now , after nearly thirty years , incurred a sequel , in which the discussion , and the former comedy and bleakness , are resumed , and in which the question of continuity of utterance within the novel once again arises . The beauty of the earlier prose is , in part , a beauty of grace notes , the pointing of sentences , charged elegance and buoyant , intelligent wit . In Take a girl like you a great sentence falls like the dew from heaven during one of the scenes in Amis when a terminally drunk man endures a sexual turmoil and fiasco , is stunned by a stunning but not very nice girl . This particular girl , a model , is putting Patrick in his place by going on about cars : " Most of my friends have them on the firm , " she said , with the sort of lift of the old proud head that he could hardly believe had not accompanied a limiting judgment on Villiers de l'Isle Adam . " In Difficulties with girls there are passages which recall that lift of the old proud head . " In silence , the two almost bowed almost stiffly to each other , behaving rather like two -- well , two somethings-or-other , thought Patrick . Two climatological dendrologists or career torturers , pre-eminent in their respective domains but divided on some technical points . " The new prose , however , is in general less embellished , more elliptical , even quite taxingly so on occasion , and yet more colloquial too . There is less style , of the kind known to Villiers de l'Isle Adam . Fewer jewels . Excellent use is made of the text of Tom Jones , but it is now less detectable that this is a writer who has done his stint of teaching English literature at university level . The voice of the novelist is heard continually in the speech of his characters . Patrick is a lord of language , as he was in the previous novel . But this novel has not just one but two barmen who could also at a pinch be hailed as lords of language . Even school-teaching Graham , who is meant to be amusingly boring , is good with words , in one of the ways that teachers sometimes are . And even Jenny , who is meant to be a mistress of plain speech , is allowed , in this comparatively austere book , a quiet felicity of phrase based on the justice of her perceptions . The lordship in question is the novelist 's , not only in the usual sense , often forgotten , that every word of the novel is his , but also because the speech of its characters can be like that of the narrator , and indeed like that of the writer of Kingsley Amis 's discursive prose . This is not the first time that such considerations have arisen for readers of his fiction . Readers of The Old Devils have asked : are its Welsh Welsh ? Its characters have been said to sound English . ( Northern Jenny Bunn , incidentally , sounds , to me , Welsh . ) There may be a matter of principle here for some of those who wish their authors to be concealed : such authors should not sound like the characters they invent , any more than they should express opinions . But the raconteurs of the extra-literary world are permitted to shape and turn the speech of the characters in their stories , and to play the pervasive evident author . And anyone who doubts whether the method can safely be transferred to literature should consult one of Amis 's best novels , Ending up . Raconteur and raisonneur , in his art as in his personal life , he is a concealed author who is evident enough in his hotly opinionated fiction : he is not given to expounding his own passionate opinions there , but can be recognised without difficulty in almost every aspect of every one of his novels , including the speech assigned to his often disputatious characters . There is a sense in which each novel of his is an opinion of his , coextensive with the work itself and rather hard , as a rule , to read off in summary . These considerations affect the difficulties which attend Difficulties with girls , and which come to the fore with the most Amis-sounding of its characters , the male lead . Amis 's novels have always been full of opinions , and have , I think , become prone to a marked ambiguity of effect , especially with regard to questions of gender and race . Patrick has plenty to say on such subjects , and he says it in the lordly way which does much to furnish the book with its presiding idiom . But are we meant to sympathise with what he says ? Here and elsewhere , the method , for all that Amis would hate to hear it , is dialectical . In the novels I am thinking of he attributes certain ideas to certain characters and utters them in the prevailing manner of the novel , while also submitting them to question within it . He can appear in so doing to have his opinions and to eat them too . And he can also appear to place the novel in a state of suspension . If the state was not present in his novels from the first , it is there in One Fat Englishman , and in Jake 's Thing . It is there in Stanley and the Women , which persuaded Marilyn Butler -- somewhat against the odds , but none the less intelligibly -- to interpret it in the London Review as a critique of male supremacy , but which has left a very different impression on others . It is compatible with the canon of artistic detachment , but it can cause controversy . Heirs to the freedoms which , on the threshold of the Sixties , Take a girl like you may be thought to have assisted in inaugurating , but which it also contrived to criticise , young people now seem to feel that the old Patrick belonged to a sexist work , and they may well feel that the old Adam has surfaced again in the new Patrick . But a solicitous critic ( Amis has had his share , for all the faces he makes ) could perhaps be counted on to demonstrate that the novelist is sorry that Patrick is sexist . Take , for example , the Jewish question as it arises in the novel . Patrick has been hired by an obnoxiously trendy mismated publisher . He labours scornfully for this Simon Giles , faintly comforted by a corner in Classical studies which has been granted him for reasons to do with the firm 's image . Between Patrick and Mrs Giles there flows , or gutters , a current of dreary sexual electricity . He fancies that Simon is Jewish , and that he gives off " a slight hot smell " . We are later tolerantly informed -- in the presiding idiom of the book , by a narrator keen , as ever , to monitor Patrick 's impressions -- that the smell was not atrocious : " not strong but easily perceptible , like a large zoo passed at a distance . " By then , however , Patrick has been informed , by an office placeman and fuddy-duddy who believes that trendiness has ruined everything , that smelly Simon , though he may be obnoxious , is not Jewish . This is a bad day for Patrick , who had volunteered that Simon was " one of a certain ... persuasion " . According to the narrator , Patrick is " so far from being anti-semitic that a couple of his best friends really were Jews " ( but who can these two best friends be -- can Ormerod , unmentioned in the later novel , be one ? ) . And now he has been put down , made to seem anti-Semitic , by a probable anti-Semite . The encounter could be read as establishing that he has been silly , while clearing him of a certain ... imputation . But it could also be read very differently . For some , it may serve as a reminder of the Kingsley Amis who once unambiguously remarked , in the course of a berating of Philip Roth , that " Jewish jokes are not funny " . Then there is the woman question , which arises in the novel in a fashion which sets us wondering , as in the past and as in the case of the above encounter , which parts of the bad behaviour on display Amis quite or largely likes . The woman question is treated together with the homosexual question . This is the mid-Sixties , and homosexuals are being released from the closet by a law enacted by Parliament late in the novel . Patrick is far from anti-homosexual , though not entirely patient with the relevant practices and pretensions . This standpoint is gathered up with others in a book which is free with descriptions of creditable and discreditable dealings on the part of those of that persuasion . Two , or three , of them are in , or moving into , the far from populous row of flats , just over the river in South London , which is inhabited by Patrick and Jenny , and by a stunning , boring wife who affords Patrick one of the novelist 's turmoils in a vulgarly-appointed borrowed flat some miles to the north . Among the few Standish neighbours on the row is Eric , long gone from the closet and married to Stevie , a he-man former semi-film-star , whom he eventually stabs . Eric is represented as sympathetic , and the counsel he imparts to Patrick on the subject of gender might almost have been imparted by Patrick : You and I are by nature , by our respective natures , males who are irresistibly attracted by a non-male principle . In your case , straight-forward , women ; in my case not straightforward , not women -- but , non-male , except anatomically . And it 's the clash between male and non-male that causes all the trouble . They 're different from us . More like children . Crying when things go wrong . Making difficulties just so as to be a person . But when Patrick says that sort of thing to Jenny , he adds that she is an exception to this law of nature . She is not , as he puts it , " that sort " of woman . Meanwhile the also sympathetic but Grahamly maddening Tim is struggling to move into a flat on the row , while supposing himself to be struggling to come out of the closet . A third homosexual on the row ? What he has to come out with is not initially clear , but it becomes clearer when a taste of gay night-life turns him off , and he trails back to his dull wife . This could be termed an uncomely version of what happens to Patrick , whose wife discovers that , at long last , she is pregnant . She is sure that this will settle them for the foreseeable future . Their relationship is still unresolved , as wise heads had foreseen in 1960 : but their marriage has gained a lease of life . The woe that is in marriage is not all that bad really . Jenny has urgently advised Tim to return to his dull wife , telling him that her dullness is the " whole point " . Those who think that Jenny herself is a little dull at times might conclude that Patrick has impaled himself on that point , like one of those Romans whose language he used to teach . He is to do a lot less swinging . " She was going to have him all to herself for at least three years , probably more like five , and a part of him for ever ... " . The novel is no persuasive advertisement for marriage , or for Jews and gays . But it is n't plain sailing either to claim it as racist and sexist . There is a difficulty with Jenny , of a kind that came with the innocent of the previous novel . She now knows more , but the iron has not entered her soul . Amid the general ventriloquism she does often manage to speak for herself . The novelist is less inward , less collusive , with her than he is with her husband -- a relation fully consonant with Eric 's law of nature -- but he wants her view to be respected , and works it too hard as a purchase on wrong thinking . Amis is still soft on her , a sentiment which is likely to strike most of his readers as natural too . She is entrusted , on one occasion , with what might seem a rudimentary version of one of his own opinions . On this occasion she is at a posh party , where she has taken a glass of champagne , but only " to be sociable " -- a motive which in anyone else would have driven Patrick to contemplate another of the umpteen blows he feels like unleashing -- when the novelist unleashes one of his phonological jokes , which play on vagaries of pronunciation . A man , back from Spain , addresses her in tones that approximate to what the Independent thought was the " well-educated voice " , and to what the Guardian thought was the " assured accent " , transmitted by the Intelligence chief responsible for the shooting of the IRA bombers in Gibraltar which preceded the arrival of the novel . Jenny understands him to say that he has had trouble on his travels " with the Reds " . " Oh , I thought they 'd taken care of them , " said Jenny . " Since that war they had there . " " They have n't , believe me . Well , not up anything you could call a " " No , I suppose that 's where they would tend to hole up . " Where can Jenny have been , in the course of her adolescence , to be willing , if only out of nervousness , to accept that the Reds in Spain have been swept out from under the bed and up into mountain caves ? It 's a very funny joke , but it works at the expense of treating her like a child , which is not at all what the novel usually intends . Amis writes here , as he has written in other books , about the distance between men and women ; here , too , is the trouble that awaits the rational hedonist who deceives the woman he lives with and loves . It is n't every comic genius who would undertake to send his talent into such painful places . Both this novel and the one which it resumes are " hung " books , in the sense that Parliaments are said to be hung . Adultery has been a hanging matter -- both in this and in the usual sense of the phrase -- for the literature of the past , and perhaps it could be suggested that both senses may at times be presented to the mind by what Amis does with the subject , and that there is no striking difference in this respect between what he did in the Sixties and what he has done in the Eighties . I do n't think this means that there is no saying what he is getting at in these works ; opinions can and will be formed , and for the extent of the present discussion I have been attempting to express one . Any such attempt has to look closely at their chastened but ultimately unchastenable hero , at his hostility , at his stylistic authority and command of the books he belongs to . Maybe there will one day be a novel from Amis which portrays the Patrick Standish of the Eighties -- more baleful , no doubt , on certain subjects , nicer to his cat , surrounded by the monuments of the New Right and by the debris of the swinging past to which he had once been a contributor . The two Patrick books are stations in a progress -- what Amis has encouraged us to call Lucky Jim 's turn to the right . This is a progress which has found its haven in the achievements of Mrs Thatcher , and the Patrick of the Eighties will have to deal with that . It will be difficult for him to be baleful about the Millennium . I would like to say a last word about Amis 's voices , and about the long words which have been or might be laid on his confident art -- a terminology for which he is unlikely to be grateful . There is a poem by his friend Philip Larkin , entitled " Letter to a Friend about Girls " , which was never published during Larkin 's lifetime but was retrieved for the Collected Poems of 1988 . It is dated December 1959 , and may therefore have been written at the time that Take a girl like you was being completed . And it might almost be the work of Graham McClintoch . To imagine this is to be aware that the aggressive term which I have applied to Amis 's novelistic method , " ventriloquism " , has the drawback of suggesting that when an author throws his voice , the character who receives it will necessarily be found to be inanimate , a dummy . This is not , of course , the case . Dummies can come to life in books , as it seems they can do for their masters on the stage : and this miracle depends , not only on the author , but also on the people he knows , who may indeed be thought to participate in what he is , and who are likely to participate in his ventriloquism . It may be that Larkin 's poem and the person we meet there participate in the ventriloquism of Amis 's novel . At a mid-point in the novel there occurs McClintoch 's complaint that people are divided into the " attractive " and the " unattractive " , rather as , according to Disraeli , as Graham duly notes , Victorian England was divided into the two nations ' of rich and poor . There is a " barrier " between the attractive and the unattractive -- between , as Graham puts it on a later occasion , the " beggars " and " choosers " of the sexual life . Convinced of his own plainness , Graham is here engaged in taking Jenny out and making a mess of kissing her . Jenny is nice about the mess , but disturbed by what he tells her -- in words that call to mind the language , and the drift , of this poem and others by Larkin , and of passages in Larkin 's fiction where Jack is denied his Jill . You ca n't imagine what it 's like not to know what it is to meet an attractive person who 's also attracted to you , can you ? Because unattractive men do n't want unattractive girls , you see . They want attractive girls . They merely get unattractive girls . I think a lot of people feel vaguely when they see two duffers marrying that the duffers must prefer it that way . Which is rather like saying that slum-dwellers would rather live in the slums than anywhere else -- there they are in the slums , are n't they ? Larkin 's poem complains in concert ; it takes up the question of what it is to be sexually debarred . The letter it sends is to an attractive friend who goes about " bagging birds " , and who belongs to a world in which the beautiful say yes to the beautiful and wildly misbehave , a world which is said to be " described on Sundays only " , in papers like the News of the World -- but which is also described in Take a girl like you . The poem begins : After comparing lives with you for years I see how I 've been losing : all the while I 've met a different gauge of girl from yours . Grant that , and all the rest makes sense as well ... As for the different " sort " of girl known to the loser : They have their world , not much compared with yours , But where they work , and age , and put off men By being unattractive , or too shy , Or having morals -- anyhow none give in ... By now , the reader may be on his way to deciding that this is the better world of the two , and to wondering if the poet is trying to get his own back . The poem might be thought self-pitying if it were more believable . Can this ever have been the trouble with Larkin ? But then I 'll be told that it 's not about him at all , in that silly sense . Whether it is or not , the poem can be called distinctive -- distinctive both of Larkin and of Amis . The mutualities of their friendship have been incorporated in the two worlds in question as they figure in Amis 's novel , where unattractiveness is a category as definite as mumps and the unattractive are absolutely and permanently unattractive to one another . These two worlds , moreover , are like the two worlds of men and women in Amis . Between men and women , too , there is said to be a barrier . And there are , in fact , several barriers in his writings : that between Jenny and the Reds could be considered another . In all this sharp distinguishing , in all this enemy thing that Amis has , there are elements of anxiety , and of misrepresentation . Many of the actions performed by many women , according to the misogynists he likes to write about , are performed by many men , and many ugly people would appear to be just as happy , and just as emotionally fulfilled , as many lovely ones . Amis also likes to write , as Larkin liked to write , about the fear of death , and it may be that this fear can be detected in the failure to notice here that both sorts of people are subject to it , as to other unavoidable misfortunes , and that both sorts die . Amis and Larkin are the same but different . The poem and novel I have attributed to them respectively can also , for certain purposes , be attributed to them both . They are pieces of writing which are distinct in law ; the author of the one could not be sued for the other , or for collaborating in it . Nevertheless a togetherness is apparent , of a kind that characterises colluders -- or friends -- rather than collaborators . It can be said of these strong-minded and independently gifted accomplices that their work shows a dimension of reciprocity and replication , of the production unit , which stands at an appreciable remove from parody and plagiarism , and from the mimicry of other people 's voices which is comprehended in the term " ventriloquism " , which Amis goes in for in private , among friends , and which is also a pleasure of the novels he writes . Their work bears witness both to the power of partnership and to the powers of expression which we feel able to attribute to groups , to some circle of friends or literary " school " -- in this case , the group which was at one time drunkenly designated the scholarship boys , angry young men or hypergamists of the Fifties . I have applied the term " ventriloquism " , in this book , to the fictions of Peter Ackroyd and Kingsley Amis . Elsewhere , Frank Kermode has applied it to the fictions of Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark ( " no matter what the characters say they all speak in some version of her voice " ) , while linking it with Bakhtin 's distinction , well-known now both in Russia and in the West , between the " monologic " and the " dialogic " imagination . The former is ventriloquial ; the latter gives " a carnival sense of the world " , and is the more hopeful . True art , or the best art , has a dialogic structure , many voices , and so has the good society . This is an author who has contributed to the Russia which has come after him -- to the emergence there , at the present time , of the demand for a lawful Opposition , for the duality of democracy . The difference yields a political meaning , in other words , and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows , and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so . It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable : the author who tells , and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist , may well , for instance , be more than capable of carnival , and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart . But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some sorts of contemporary author and to some of what went before . The status of comedy is crucial to the debate , and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's , or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right . Against this monologic Amis can be set , by way of alter ego , the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's discussion of Difficulties with girls , which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism , and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis , so often supposed an enemy of Modernism , is really a Modernist . She begins by recalling a remark made to her a long time ago by Larkin , about difficulties encountered in his private life -- a remark which consisted of a joke to do with " the impossibility of relations between men and women " , followed by the notion that " women ought really to marry each other " , followed by " but that would be wrong , would n't it ? " And she notes that the same remark , or the same sentences , can be found in Amis 's novel . What interests her , apparently , is not the remark itself , but " the degree to which the piece of recall " -- her piece of recall , presumably -- " failed to affect the novel in any way " . The novel was left " curiously unaffected " by this discovery . It is as if the discovery could have no meaning for anyone experiencing the novel -- which would certainly be curious . Barbara Everett 's subtle and disconcerting essay proceeds to say that " Difficulties with girls is much more like The Waste Land than Kenner leaves room for guessing it is " , in the book by him which she is examining . " This theoretically realistic and humorous novel is not unlike The Waste Land , the showpiece of Modernism and Impersonality " -- which gives the impression that the realistic and humorous can only be deemed compatible with impersonality if they can also be deemed theoretical , and that the novel may not be very funny . Soon afterwards , though , she writes : " I do n't want to suggest that Difficulties with girls and The Waste Land really have much to do with each other . " So the two works are said to be both like one another and unlike . What they have in common is that each escapes " the limitations of the personal " . Everett explains : All knowledge of life and lives , and indeed of history , is a good in itself , and seems likely to inform literary intelligence ; and in addition Amis 's novels would rather confuse if thought to be the work of an early Tudor writer . Beyond this , the use of biography , its actual ability to throw light ( rather than just to be entertaining and nice to have around ) , seems to be a fantasy . Kenner 's fantasy is being discussed in terms of the view -- with which Kenner can be expected to be very familiar -- that the goals of a biographically-minded criticism are in some measure fantastic . " Beyond this " , however , leaves indefinite the point at which , or frequency with which , the use of biography deserves to be called by that name . She is saying that this good thing , this knowledge , can be used -- to tell us , for example , that Amis is not a Tudor writer : but she is rather more moved to say at the same time that it ca n't or can hardly be used , devoted as she is to the thought of a separation between , in this case , Amis 's friendships and politics , his life -- and his art . His novel is art all right . It has the sui generis of art . It has art 's power to translate , to abstract from the circumstances in which it originates . There is no biographical key with which it can be unlocked -- and I have not been trying to turn one in this essay of mine , which does not believe it , for that matter , to be locked . Nevertheless it is an utterance of the Amis who has made himself known on other occasions , and it can be none the worse for being read by those who are able and disposed to pay intelligent attention to this range of information -- which is not to imply that the information may not be disastrously misunderstood . The choice here may in a sense be one between knowing more and knowing less . Should Amis 's friendship with Larkin -- which goes unstated in Amis 's fiction , but which is not absent from it -- matter to the reader of that fiction ? Why should it not , if there are grounds for thinking that it matters to the fiction ? The report that Eliot was eventually to say of The Waste Land that " to me it was only the relief of a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life " is no more a licence to treat the poem as totally and unreservedly autobiographical than it is a conclusive estimate of its significance . But the report is worth knowing by those who want to know the poem . Both Amis and Eliot can be considered seasoned disapprovers , and it is probable that Amis shares the other writer 's distaste for the biographical critic , whose activities may be responsibly conducted , and are generally acknowledged to have been successful at times , but have often been reckoned to fail . But if this is so , it can be seen to make possible biographical connections of a usable kind . It connects the two writers , and it connects each one of them with their works . The two works of theirs which Barbara Everett compares are neither of them an escape from the spacious confines of the personal . In this respect they are alike , and like all other works of art . But in many respects they are very different , and they come from different times : they are separated from one another by three-quarters of a century . It would take someone who was very much intent on a punishment of biography to think of pointing the way to Difficulties with girls by mentioning its proximity to The Waste Land . Polymorphous Roth AUTHORSHIP can be called , if anything or anyone can , dual , equivocal . The works of authors are replicas , and they are unique . They are and are not autobiographical . An author is and is not his book . In the later years of the Eighties a series of events and episodes has served to direct the attention of British readers to the issue of authorship and its autobiographical character or constituent . I am thinking of the death of Primo Levi , an autobiographer , and by certain standards an amateur ; of the threatened death of the novelist Salman Rushdie ; and of the discovery of the fascist sympathies formerly exhibited by the literary theorist Paul de Man . And I am also thinking of the identification of Rahila Khan -- a novelist supposedly Asian and female -- as an Anglican vicar ; and of the attempt to thwart a biography by the Englishman Ian Hamilton of the American J. D. Salinger , whose novels tell the story of his life , but who does not want anyone else to do so , preferring to keep his facts to himself . Soon after Hamilton 's battle-scarred book came out , moreover , in the spring of 1988 , there appeared in Britain a kind of memoir entitled The Facts-A Novelist 's Autobiography in which the issue was addressed in some passages of exceptional interest -- the gaze and forehead of Olympian Zeus after the outcries and the special and professional pleading which had surrounded all but one of these other events . The novelist was Philip Roth , no stranger to outcries himself , whose fictions reveal a multiple self which corresponds to the multiple self of Philip Roth . They can be said to determine and to indetermine , both to record , and to distort and desert , the facts of his life . He has now told the same story " straight " -- or comparatively straight . " On the pendulum of self-exposure that oscillates between aggressively exhibitionistic Mailerism and sequestered Salingerism , I 'd say that I occupy a midway position " , explains Roth in The Facts -- in a prefatory letter to his alter ego of earlier books , the novelist Nathan Zuckerman , who is granted a letter of reply at the end of this one and a perusal of the intervening narrative . Roth also explains that he was " educated to believe that the independent reality of the fiction is all there is of importance and that writers should remain in the shadows " . As the world knows , Roth grew up in Newark , New Jersey , a second-generation American Jew , and he was to turn into a citizen of the world , a famous cosmopolitan author . In middle age he has experienced a breakdown , an identity crisis , which followed a long illness and an operation . He felt a need to discover who he was , and to write directly about that , and about his books , to step out of the shadows . His first book , the collection of stories entitled Goodbye , Columbus , fixed him in the popular mind , from 1959 , as an " enemy of the Jews " -- a condition aggravated by the onanistic bravura and scandalous mad success of the grotesquely imaginative Portnoy 's Complaint ( 1969 ) , and not much improved in recent years by The Counterlife ( 1987 ) , in which various escapes from Jewish America , including an escape to Israel , are projected , and in which Zuckerman and his dentist brother Henry are both imagined to have ailing hearts and to undertake gruesome surgery in order to restore the sexual potency suspended by their medication . Defenders of the Jewish American pieties and proprieties , and those in Israel for whom the Diaspora Jew is a rootless cosmopolitan , had marked Roth as a bad man , and in their eyes he has yet to turn into a good one . In the fine and fairly straight title-story of the first collection , a well-to-do Jewish family expels a poor boy to whom they feel they have been " nice " and who has repaid them by sleeping with their daughter . The poor boy , who resembles Philip Roth , tells the story in which he takes part , and does so in a manner that can be considered uncontroversial . In the fictions that lay ahead , however , the relationship between the author and his characters is subjected to an intense elaboration . It became , in a sense , the story Roth now had to tell . A dance ensues in which he and his characters exchange identities . The poor boy continued to fight with propriety in these fictions . But now there 's the possibility of a truce . The Facts shows signs of a wish to be " reconciled with the tribe " , and indeed to be a " nice fellow " . At the same time , though less abrasive , the book is only intermittently less sophisticated than those that preceded it . The " distrustful fellow " of the past is present , and not just as a commemorative item . A multiple Roth is once again in evidence . He knows how important to the power of his writings had been his fight with the Jews and the outrageous candour of his sexual descriptions , and in the recent writings this knowledge is conveyed by the proximity of an imagined truce to an imagined impotence . Nathan Zuckerman is a persona 's persona : Roth begat Peter Tarnopol -- who begat Nathan Zuckerman -- in the novel of 1974 , My Life as a Man . Zuckerman has enabled Roth to deal with the question of the offence he has given to righteous Jews , and to come to terms with the rebellious , psychedelic , philo-Semitic Sixties , when Roth 's writing went , with the times , derisive and fantastic . The Zuckerman books are a medley of differences and affinities between what we are able to infer about Roth 's life and what he has made of it in art . In propria persona , Roth discourses in The Facts about his relationship with his younger brother , Sandy . The tone is judicious and kind . This is a nice fellow speaking . Because Sandy was embarked on a marriage and a career pointing him in a more conventional direction than mine , planning the sort of life that looked to me to have more obviously evolved from the background I 'd put behind me , it did n't seem to me that he would have had the wherewithal -- " morally " , as I would have been quick to say then -- to help me through my predicament or , if he did , that it was possible for me with my values , to solicit his assistance . This was hubris , pure and simple ... Zuckerman 's relationship with his brother Henry is , in contrast , often sanguinary , as gruesome as their respective operations . Zuckerman Unbound ( 1981 ) reaches its climax at one of Roth 's frequent funerals -- in this case , that of Zuckerman 's father -- after which Henry charges Nathan with killing their parent by writing " that book " , the liberated Carnovsky , and with believing like the bastard he is that fiction does n't have consequences . Nathan is a swinger , who is blamed for whoring after and mistreating gentile women . " Even your shiksas go down the drain when they do n't tickle your fancy anymore . " Meanwhile The Counterlife attributes to Henry the verdict that " exploiting and distorting family secrets was my brother 's livelihood " . Philip Roth 's contribution to The Facts is ( as distinct from Nathan Zuckerman 's ) significantly milder , in relation to family matters , than what we get in these abrasive comic fictions : but then the fictions can be nice too . The conversation in Zuckerman Unbound between the novelist and his mother , in which he tenderly instructs her in how to field the intrusions that arise from the Carnovsky outrage , reads authentically , autobiographically , enough , while showing a good Jewish son . The Zuckerman books help one to imagine how Roth has faced the reproach that he has derided his family and sold their secrets . But perhaps it is not too simple to suggest that we are also conscious of Zuckerman as a deflection of the wrath over Roth which works by making Zuckerman responsible for the outrage . We are conscious of what Zuckerman does for Roth : when he helps a man to gather his spilt heart pills , it is Roth helping himself by assigning a small mercy . In The Facts , the tough guy with his shiksas , the supposedly " self-hating " Diaspora Jew , can be " tenderised " -- a word Roth likes , for all the awkwardness it imparts to the operations to which it refers -- into a sort of uxorious submission where his parents are concerned . This is a state which Zuckerman experiences and which he sends up . In the fictional conversation about adverse publicity a good mother meets a son anxious to reassure her , while alive to the comedy of it . " As long as you know what you 're doing " , she ventures , adding : " And as long as you know that it is right . " " I do " and " It is " , replies Zuckerman . The Facts is the more filial book of the two . The facts show a good son , one who is less quick to see the jokes . Shiksas were to promise an escape from Jewish America , as the promised land of Israel was eventually to be evoked as doing for Henry Zuckerman . The Facts is preoccupied with one shiksa in particular : the deadly Josie , whom Roth marries , who forces his hand in the matter by faking an abortion , who comes near to destroying him , and who may have been , according to the Zuckerman letter at the end of the book , an alcoholic . When Josie dies in a car crash Roth feels relief . Her death delivers him from the ordeal of divorce , as frequent as funerals are in his books . He had left her and gone to live with an upper-class woman , had soared to the opposite end of the scale from Josie , whose attraction for him had been that of a splenetic victim from the lower depths of the goyim : but Josie had refused a divorce and the ordeal had dragged on . At one stage no less a person than Bobby Kennedy , soon to accompany Josie to the grave , had offered to help Roth gain his freedom . In the liberated world of radical chic , we may be intended to think , favours could be done for the right person . The Facts says that the " crack-up " of 1987 had induced " fiction fatigue " , a need to " demythologise myself and play it straight " . Leaving off with the " imaginative fury " might make it possible to " unlock meanings that fictionalising has obscured , distended , or even inverted " . At the same time , he accepts the " obvious " fact that " facts are never just coming at you but are incorporated by an imagination that is formed by your previous experience " . At the end of the book , though , Zuckerman confronts Roth with the opinion that the latter has made a mistake in trying to tame or to shed his imagination in the foregoing text , that fiction is superior to fact , and that the factuality of The Facts is specious . Roth would appear to believe both the claim and the counter-claim as to the value of the text , and to believe , too , both that the Roth part of the book does not represent an exercise of the imagination and that it does . It seems reasonable to think that The Facts is imagined , and that it could promote a benevolent view of the literal or faithful -- as opposed to the fantastically transgressive -- imagination , which may or may not , in any given case , be directly concerned with the facts of the author 's own life . It is a work which might well shed a tender light on the novella " Goodbye , Columbus " . Later in the present book there is a discussion of Roth 's regard for the literalism of Primo Levi , who is at his most imaginative when least imaginary , who was not all that successful at imagining things in the style commended in the Zuckerman letter : and in The Facts a related meaning is apparent . Portnoy 's Complaint is a work of the furious imagination spoken of , and rendered debatable , in The Facts . It is seen in The Facts to belong to the times in which the writer lived when he wrote the novel , when opposition to the Vietnam War , and to a President Johnson perceived as monstrous , took to the street-wisdom of a farcical obscenity . The Facts is able to treat the historical conditioning of Portnoy 's Complaint in a way in which the novel itself was not in a position to do . It has the benefit of hindsight . But it would also appear to know its own place in history in a way which an exercise of the furious imagination in art can sometimes seem to prevent . Different genres , different imaginations . Roth has left off with his mythologising fury -- and his memoir lets us know that the benefits that come to the writer who tries , or even seems , to stick to the facts may amount to something more than those of hindsight . It informs us of the " forces " which shaped Roth 's tours de force of the Sixties and early Seventies , and it informs us of how he came to be where he is now . He has travelled from the liberated past , when imagination took power , to the liberation of an interest in fact -- a state which may or may not prove to have been , for Roth , partial or provisional , and which The Facts , in its totality , manages to enclose in an ironised uncertainty . He can look here at times a little like a man who has taken the first steps in a descent from the high ground of Self-consciousness , impersonality , fantastication and ironic indirection -- not that this has lately been , or has ever been , literature 's only ground . But perhaps it will come to be thought by his readers that these successive attitudes to the autobiographical , and to plain speaking , in art are equally valid , equally reversible . This is a view which would accord with the dualistic tradition to which his novels predominantly belong . The Facts presents , among its various dualities , the reminder that the one and only Philip Roth is like Saul Bellow . Bellow supported Roth 's early work , and Roth 's work was to bear a resemblance to Bellow 's . They are two of a kind , it seems to me , authors of a paranoid comedy of the dualistic imagination , while also different . Roth got to know Bellow in Chicago , where Roth worked as a university teacher , finding it a lively place . It was lively enough to marry Bellow to a " stylish Radcliffe graduate " of whom Roth had been " enamoured " -- if we are to assume that The Facts has not imagined the connection . It is a connection not unlike some of those made in the fiction of both authors . The memoir sets us asking if Philip Roth knows who he is . He is angry , suspicious , overbearing ; he can be very like the Zuckerman berated in the fiction as " this unsatisfiable , suspect , quarrelsome novelist " . And yet he is nice . He is tough and he is tender , wrathful and ruthful . This mixed condition he shares with many others , not all of them writers ; it is a condition we are entitled to call traditional . And it is a condition which can be recognised in the reception of his work . There are readers whom , as Zuckerman is the first ( or second ) to acknowledge , he can drive to the complaint that he has sex , and family matters , and Jewish matters , on the brain : " I want him to take his manuscript and mail it to his mother " , as I have heard them cry . There are times when his world can appear to consist of Jews and of those to whom a Jew might wish to escape -- such as America 's well-heeled Wasps , or the semi-imaginary anti-Semites of Gloucestershire who figure affluently in The Counterlife . But he is also a writer of remarkable ability who has managed to capture and to keep the readership he has bewildered and delighted and offended , and whose work is strong in an intelligent and generous-hearted awareness of public matters , some of them quite remote from the Family Roth : The Counterlife , for instance , carries a telling serio-comic critique of the hard line in Israel , the Israeli toughness , that refuses to " give ground " . In The Facts he examines his own vexed state with reference to the vexed question of whether it is better to make things up , and to distort them , and by contemplating his earlier re-invention of the time-honoured dualistic account of literature and human nature . His shiksas and replicas , hostilities and escapes , have taken part in a great game of long duration , and he can be said to be reviewing the state of play . Escape , he thinks , is Jewish . He knows that it is also dualistic . The dualistic ambience in literature has long been influential , but has remained controversial , and it is both influential and controversial in these annals of the House of Roth . Zuckerman 's proposal of marriage to Maria in The Counterlife is an indication of its importance , and of the importance of escape both for the tradition and for the unsatisfiable Roth . " Because I 've decided to give up the artificial fiction of being myself for the genuine , satisfying falseness of being somebody else . Marry me . " Here , it is as if both the single and the plural accounts of human nature were specious . In general , though , he has been faithful , in most of what he has written , to a version of the mobile and multiple , mysterious and fugitive self . At the end of The Counterlife there is a letter from Nathan Zuckerman to Maria on this subject which has the force of a statement of allegiance on the part of Philip Roth . The reader knows that it is Zuckerman 's statement too , that it is fiction , and is likely to remind himself that it could well belong to the infinite regress of the dualistic indeterminable , where claim and counter-claim alternate indefinitely . There can be no claim that this is what Roth really thinks : the affidavit that might have been contained in The Facts has been withheld . It may be that he really thinks there is nothing that he really thinks . But if Roth dissents from the statement , then imagining how he came to write most of his books becomes a problem . Zuckerman tells his Maria : Being Zuckerman is one long performance and the very opposite of what is thought of as being oneself . In fact , those who most seem to be themselves appear to me people impersonating what they think they might like to be , believe they ought to be , or wish to be taken to be by whoever is setting standards . So in earnest are they that they do n't even recognise that being in earnest is the act . For certain self-aware people , however , this is not possible : to imagine themselves being themselves , living their own real , authentic , or genuine life , has for them all the aspects of a hallucination . I realise that what I am describing , people divided in themselves , is said to characterise mental illness , and is the absolute opposite of our idea of emotional integration . The whole Western idea of mental health runs in precisely the opposite direction : what is desirable is congruity between your self-consciousness and your natural being . Zuckerman is seeking to deny the traditional connection between illness and psychic division which is reaffirmed in the novel as a whole , and which is also reaffirmed in The Facts , and at the same time to deny that there is a traditional belief in division or multiplicity , a long-standing sense of selfhood as a chimera . He goes on to say to Maria that it 's all impersonation -- in the absence of a self , one impersonates selves , and after a while impersonates best the self that best gets one through . If you were to tell me that there are people , like the man upstairs to whom you now threaten to turn yourself in , who actually do have a strong sense of themselves , I would have to tell you that they are only impersonating people with a strong sense of themselves -- to which you could correctly reply that since there is no way of proving whether I 'm right or not , this is a circular argument from which there is no escape . All I can tell you with certainty is that I , for one , have no self , and that I am unwilling or unable to perpetrate upon myself the joke of a self . The man upstairs , the first husband whom Maria is to leave , is not " self-aware " -- unlike Zuckerman , who declares , on behalf of the self-aware , that he has no self and that the self is a joke . But Roth must know that it is likely to be no joke to those who are reading his book . Zuckerman says here that performance is all there is , that person and persona are one . But we may feel on reading this that it takes two to perform -- that performance requires , in however regressive or circular a fashion , the self that so many people believe they have , and that this epistolary Zuckerman exhibits here , in a display of inadvertence which may or may not implicate Philip Roth . This is a self which there may be " no way of proving " . It is a self which is proving , for philosophers , hard to prove . But it is a self which readers of the book can only rarely have found it hard to experience . The novelist referred to himself once as " amorphous Roth " . " Polymorphous Roth " might be nearer the mark . I think that many of his readers would be prepared to bear witness to the sense that somewhere in there among the changing shapes is the usual nonpareil . In the ambience and tradition to which I am referring personality is defined in terms of breadth and contrast ; the effect is at once stereophonically-internal -- a number of speakers has been installed , so to speak -- and invasive . There is more than one Roth . And in what Roth writes Roth and Bellow meet . But neither of them is incapable of pursuing the artificial fiction of being himself . No one would lightly believe that either of them has ever found it hard to tell the difference between himself and somebody else . Dualistic explanations are moving , and intriguing : but they are often thought , even by proponents , to be far-fetched , fictional , theoretical , counter-intuitive . That Bellow , this participant in Roth 's inner life , can also be said to be out there in the world as his friend , and perhaps his rival , is a fact which does not help one to decide whether or not to trust the reports of literary duality -- what comes in has to have been out -- but it is very much in the tradition . The tradition gives many convincing pictures of the inwardness and invasiveness of friends and rivals . Brothers may be rivals , and they may be internalised . Roth 's fiction internalises the brother identified in The Facts . In The Counterlife Henry , the " distrustful fellow " who distrusts his distrustful brother 's " wallowing heroes " , is at one with the creator of those heroes , and with the heroes , and with the creator 's creator . Nathan enters Henry and Henry enters Nathan . Maria bursts into italics ( and out of character ) to say to Nathan : " You are your brother ! " And Nathan says to Henry : " We are all each other 's authors . " A universal fellowship obtains . The definition of personality which is harboured in such procedures has moved and influenced several generations of writers . The art that comes of them is one in which imagination takes power , the power to distort and exaggerate , in which difference of person is suspended , in which the experience of time is as it is in dreams . The story that is told is a story which never ends -- and which risks losing shape and momentum -- because it is a story told of himself by a living author , an author who has yet to end , whose isolate 's imaginative fury lives on to tell another tale , some more of his own story . This fury can look like an onanistic or a solipsistic fury . Mail that to your mother ! It goes without saying that the definition has been responsible for a major literature . But about many of its manifestations there can be something ominous -- something that is acutely understood and eloquently exposed in The Counterlife . This is a generic something : I am speaking here of a literary practice long and widely and variously undertaken , in relation to which Roth is both critic and executant . But it should also be said that some elements of this description of mine could be taken to characterise the activity , sometimes ominous enough in its human implications , of all imaginative writers , however remote they may be from the dualistic confederacy . The caveats expressed in The Counterlife apply to all occasions when , in whatever genre or style , autobiography imposes itself upon , overwrites , the world . By Roth , as by his predecessors in the dualistic art , this definition has been correlated with breakdown , madness , though , as we have seen , Zuckerman seeks to exert a counterclaim in his letter to Maria . And it has evolved in contrast with character -- that other , earlier product of the literary imagination -- and with purpose and achievement . There are times when it might seem that this is a definition which can produce the sense of a self which is both amorphous and autonomous , of a doubtful self which also serves to cast doubt on the human world that lies beyond the subjective individual -- a world which some writers are , and some are not , very cunning in , and which is inhabited by people with a working knowledge of who they are and what they are doing . This is a knowledge which has been impugned in literature , and which has deteriorated there . The books I am speaking of are , among others , books which pursue the idea of an escape from personality and from society , and in which personality and society are seen -- as in Zuckerman 's letter to Maria -- to be aspects of a single threat . Roth 's turn towards fact -- admittedly , an imagined and far from indisputable fact -- will appear to some to signal a turn towards the self and towards the outside world . Such a reading could well be found to have attributed too much to a recoil , a respite , a provisional position . He is unlikely to have lost his distrust of the self ; and he is likely ( and welcome ) to resume his furious fictions . But when he does resume them , when the time comes for him to make his next leap , the suggestions made in the course of this affair of his fiction fatigue and literal turn -- suggestions which receive both rebuttal and support from within the shape-changing dialectic represented by The Counterlife -- will not deserve to be forgotten . Levi 's Oyster THE Italian writer Primo Levi died on 11 April 1987 , to the dismay of his readers . There was a time when it must have seemed to many of them that he would never receive a bad review , or even a cross word . His first book , If this is a man , about his months in Auschwitz , and its sequel , The Truce , were hard to fault , and the successive publications of his middle age have been greeted by an admiration responsive both to his skills as a writer and to his character as a man . i In October 1985 , however , the chauvinistic American Jewish magazine Commentary did succeed in performing the outlandish act of disparaging Levi and his books . " Alas " , wrote Fernanda Eberstadt , a German-American , the later ones are inferior to the first two , and alas , the personal character imparted by his writings -- freely imparted , one might add , and yet not unreservedly -- is flawed . " Reading Primo Levi " is in some respects a strong essay . The later books are in large measure accurately described , and the experience of the assimilated Jew in Italy , where the Jews came to harm under Mussolini but where they were never the strangers they have been in several other countries , is summarised in a well-informed and pertinent fashion . At the same time , the article is tainted by what seems to be a desire to inflict damage on Levi 's reputation , of a kind which may be thought to serve the ideological tendency of the magazine in which it appeared . So what is wrong with Levi and his Levi-like writings ? It is made to seem that he was a stranger , a gentleman , a " watcher from the sidelines " . He was " cursed with a tin ear for religion " . He could not get on with the believing Jews from Eastern Europe whose religion and traditions he neither shared nor understood . As a result , there are " no Jews as such " in his Auschwitz book . But many Jews are not believers , and are still , for most people , including themselves , palpably Jewish . He also had , the article conveys , a tin ear for the ordinary man . He is like the poet Ausonius , alas -- that Silver Age abstainer from the world and connoisseur of oysters . Literary criticism is doing here what it often does : it has gone for the faults and , in so doing , inverted the truth . When is a Jew not a Jew ? When he does not accept the religion revealed in the Old Testament . The Primo Levi who is read by Fernanda Eberstadt is a man who is unable to write about Jews -- though he does in fact write about them with great sympathy , believers and unbelievers alike -- and who has no feeling for people whose background and abilities are different from his own , though the joy of Levi 's work , for other readers , is very often that he has such feelings , that he knows himself to be , while also knowing himself not to be , an ordinary man , a worker , a man who worked as an industrial chemist and who was no less of a worker when he wrote books . The Levi who emerged from a regime of cruelty and humiliation with his judgement intact , his mind not closed , neither vengeful nor forgetful , and who wrote a noble and rational book about what had happened to him , is mentioned only cursorily and as if concessively by Fernanda Eberstadt . It is not the case that all her objections are mistaken . But their accumulation is very far from the complicated truth . The article leads you to wonder about her religious faith , if she has one , and about where it stands in relation to the outlook of the editor of Commentary , author of a book about his ambitions for worldly success : Making it must be the least pious book that has ever been written . The stress on Levi 's insensitivity to religion is allowed to suggest that all Jews are religious , and there are readers for whom this might signal the corollary that all Jews are Zionists , and are likely to be supporters of Israeli government policy . By these standards , Levi would appear to be an imperfect Jew , and this could well be an opinion that underlies the talk about his later books being not nearly as good as his earlier ones . Here is an assimilated Jew , a Diaspora Jew , unsound on Zion . Among the principal references to Israel in Levi 's writings is one which is , from a Zionist point of view , tin-eared . The reference occurs in The Drowned and the Saved , of which a translation was published in 1988 , on the anniversary of his death . In this collection of pieces which revert to themes pursued in If this is a man Levi writes : " Desperate , the Jewish survivors , in flight from Europe after the great shipwreck , have created in the bosom of the Arab world an island of Western civilisation , a portentous palingenesis of Judaism , and the pretext for renewed hatred . " There are those for whom it is not Jewish to speak in this way about Israel . It is odd to speak of the creation of a state as the " pretext " for anything : the translator may possibly be responsible for the oddity here , as for the orotundity that precedes it . But the passage certainly suggests that there was a distance between Levi 's view of Israel and the views that Commentary chooses to publish . The second sentence of the issue of May 1988 refers to the first twenty years of the state : " Threatening to " push the Jews into the sea " , the Arab world reformulated the Nazi theory of Lebensraum in Mediterranean terms : there was no room in the region for a Jewish homeland . " Arabs who had been expelled from their land and thrust into the condition of Jewish refugees are hereby reformulated as imperialist aggressors and as Nazis . This is reminiscent of the sort of inversion a fault-finding literary criticism can produce -- which is not to deny , which is indeed to admit , that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults , including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary . The magazine 's line on such matters would also appear to be remote from , and distinctly harder than , that taken in its dying days by the Reagan Administration . George Schultz travelled to the Middle East in the summer of 1988 to spread the word that " the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the frustration of Palestinian rights is a dead-end street . The belief that this can continue is an illusion . " It is a measure of the grim recalcitrance of the region 's problems that Schultz 's message was reported to have been saluted by a strike called in protest among the Palestinians of the occupied territories . Meanwhile Fernanda Eberstadt has been practising as an expert on captivity and escape , and on the beliefs established for later generations by the children of Israel . She has written in the same magazine ( June 1987 ) on the Book of Exodus , warning that a reading of the Bible as literature , rather than as sacred text , " can not lift heavenward " . In the article on his work which appeared in 1985 Levi is at one point examined with reference to Leviticus . She takes exception to a story of his about a Jewish Communist , an inhabitant of the camps , who fasts there on Yom Kippur . She observes that the prisoner is following a prohibition laid down in the Old Testament , but that a rabbinical ruling had allowed Jews to eat in the camps on Yom Kippur in order to stay alive . It is not clear why this is a reproach to Levi , whose story concerns a man whose piety is idiosyncratic , especially severe . Two years after this , in February 1987 , she praised a Gulag memoir by Gustav Herling . A World Apart is a " truly golden " work , despite the presence in it , apparently , of a foul anti-Semitism . Herling is thought to resemble Dostoevsky , whose Prototypical prison book , The House of the Dead , has in it a mansion tenanted by obnoxious , caricatured Jews . A World Apart is , " despite " its author 's socialism , a " deeply religious book " , in which she has at times the sense of " a man talking to God " . She displays more sympathy for this anti-Semitic Moses , for this religious man who is against Jews and against the Soviet system , than she does for Jews who are not religious . Whether or not she has talked to God , she has certainly been reviewing for him . Levi , the expert on metals , would have had no difficulty in telling the difference between gold and tin . I have heard that he was saddened by these writings of Fernanda Eberstadt 's , in which his own writings are faulted . Two months after the Herling piece was published Levi committed suicide , throwing himself down the staircase of the house in Turin where he was born and grew up , where he wrote about his life in the camp at a desk which stood where his cradle had stood , a house he shared with his wife and mother . He was 68 years old . I do n't suggest that these unfavourable writings pushed him to do what he did , though I do n't mind suggesting that the bigotry and vicarious piety they may be reckoned to contain could be classed among the negative experiences of the last months of his life . I have in fact no explanation to offer as to how he came to die , and it may be that no trustworthy explanation will ever be achieved . Levi was an author who , without detriment to the other people who figure in his books , wrote all the time about himself , both in autobiographical and in fictional form . The modes which he adopted were such as to license elisions and lacunae , to enable him to leave out bits of his life -- a procedure which would seem to be connected with his scepticism about what can be known about people by biographers . In Moments of Reprieve he remarks : " What the " true " image of each of us may be in the end is a meaningless question . " In The Periodic Table he mentions a woman " dear to my heart " who was murdered at Auschwitz : but the book on Auschwitz does not discuss his relationship with her . In The Wrench he creates the rigger Faussone , the practical man whose cranes girdle the world and who keeps returning , a little heavy-footed , to the house in Turin where two old aunts fuss over his welfare : Faussone was spoken of as " my alter ego " , and the book has to struggle to accommodate him as a second person , available for interview by Levi . These omissions and transpositions indicate that Levi could well have kept to himself any plan he may have formed to end his life . During the meeting with him a few months before his death which was recorded in an article published in the London Review , Philip Roth found him as keen as mustard : here was someone who listened , with the intent stillness of a chipmunk . Levi had a high opinion of the grain of mustard , and of salt . Fascism did not like these substances . He associated the grain of mustard with his own activities , with Roth 's , with Jews generally , with the awkwardness and tartness and wholesomeness of idiosyncrasy and dissent . It was , or could be called , an impurity . It was the taste of the stranger -- who might at the same time be rooted , as he himself was , in some national life . Back in Italy , after his departure from Auschwitz and his wanderings through Europe , he found that " the things I had seen and suffered were burning inside of me " , and that he wanted to write about them . These words of his , in The Periodic Table , refer to some words of the past . " I felt like Coleridge 's Ancient Mariner , who waylays on the street the wedding guests going to the feast , inflicting on them the story of his misfortune . " He beg an work as a chemist in a paint factory . Then came the meeting with the woman whom he was to marry , a meeting about which he writes in the same book . In a few hours I felt reborn and replete with new powers , washed clean and cured of a long sickness , finally ready to enter life with joy and vigour ; equally cured was suddenly the world around me , and exorcised the name and face of the woman who had gone down into the lower depths with me and had not returned . My very writing became a different adventure , no longer the dolorous itinerary of a convalescent , no longer a begging for compassion and friendly faces , but a lucid building , which now was no longer solitary ; the work of a chemist who weighs and divides , measures and judges on the basis of assured proofs , and strives to answer questions . These remarks concerning If this is a man do not describe the kind of book which runs easily to sequels , and which is easy to live up to . Nor do they describe the sort of thing we are supposed to like very much . The first two autobiographies , that is to say , are the kind of book to which a tradition of literary interpretation has been inimical , imagining for itself a literature of impersonality , in which autobiography is subsumed , invisible . Philip Roth 's article refers to this issue in referring to the later book If not now , when ? -- Levi 's " Eastern " , an adventure story of Jewish partisans during the closing months of the war , led by the Communist fighter-fiddler Gedaleh . " With his left hand he snatched the gun from the Pole 's hands , and with his right he gave him a violent blow to the ear . " Roth says to Levi in the course of the interview embodied in his article : " Your other books are perhaps less " imaginary " as to subject-matter but strike me as more imaginative in technique . The motive behind If not now , when ? seems more narrowly tendentious -- and consequently less liberating to the writer -- than the impulse that generates the autobiographical works . " Levi explains that he had amused himself by writing a " Western " and that he had wanted to write a hopeful book . I wished to assault a commonplace still prevailing in Italy : a Jew is a mild person , a scholar ( religious or profane ) , unwarlike , humiliated , who tolerated centuries of persecution without ever fighting back . It seemed to me a duty to pay homage to those Jews who , in desperate conditions , had found the courage and the skill to resist . I cherished the ambition to be the first ( perhaps the only ) Italian writer to describe the Yiddish world . I intended to " exploit " my popularity in my country in order to impose upon my readers a book centred on the Ashkenazi civilisation , history , language and frame of mind , all of which are virtually unknown in Italy , except by some sophisticated readers of Joseph Roth , Bellow , Singer , Malamud , Potok , and of course yourself . Levi 's explained intention does not mean that there is no autobiography in the book . The wish to evoke a Jewish resistance to Nazism relates to a history which comprehends his own writings and example . And in the portrayal of the mechanic Mendel there is a portrayal of Levi . Philip Roth is right , however , to point to the limitations of the book , and to point to a law of Levi 's work in general : the less imaginary it is , the more imaginative -- the more literal the better . Let us praise , more than we do , and as we can here , the literal writer . But there is no doing so unless we accept that the literal writer has an imagination . Levi can sometimes appear incapable of fiction , but it is no less apparent that everything he wrote was fiction . He was well-aware of the sense in which he made up what happened to him , imagined his misfortune . In calling his recent book about his own early life by the name of The Facts , Philip Roth is issuing a challenge -- expecting his readers to know that there are no bare facts , and obliging them to think hard about what happens in the recounting of the facts of a life . Levi would have understood that challenge , just as I think he would have been happy to agree that it is possible to speak without contradiction of the literal imagination . Levi 's words to Roth about the adventure story If not now , when ? bring to mind the art of the Russian Jewish writer Isaac Babel , who rode with Budyonny 's Red Cavalry after the Revolution , through scenes of hardship and atrocity . Babel 's art is imaginative , figurative . It has been said , by Dan Jacobson , that he " aestheticises " his response to violence . This tendency has no counterpart in Levi , and it may be doubtful whether it could live with the subject-matter of the camps . Babel 's bad times could be turned into art -- an art which has been seen to release him , as it were , from his subject , and which has also been seen to hesitate . He felt imprisoned by his religious upbringing in Odessa , and was to remember " the rotted Talmuds of my childhood " . And he was drawn to the grace and violence to be found among his Cossacks . But he was also drawn to the Jews whom he met in their Polish villages , victims of persecution and war , " old Jews with prophets " beards and passionate rags ' , to their ruined ghettoes and synagogues . To such scenes his narrator is introduced by the shopkeeper Gedali , believer in a peaceful Revolution . Levi 's Gedaleh and Babel 's Gadali are opposing faces of the Central European Jew in times of crisis . Action , power , are thought to be contrasted , in Babel 's stories , with learning , devotion , resignation , suffering -- those Jewish things . His ambivalence is a bespectacled look at the long legs of the divisional commander , which were " like girls sheathed to the neck in shining riding-boots " . The image -- summoned by a narrator whose exhausted dreams are filled with girls -- is like nothing we would ever meet in the literal Levi . But the literal Levi is a writer who has his own way of interesting himself in the contrasts which have been attributed to Babel . Levi was interested in action , purpose , work , and capable of them : and the capacity may have been formed in contention with a desire to withdraw and perhaps to give up . I think myself that this was the case , and that it scarcely makes him very different from many other hard-working people . The desire can be surmised , without recourse to hindsight , in some of what he wrote , but is far from being the point of what he wrote . Work is the supreme subject in Levi . " We can and must fight to see that the fruit of labour remains in the hands of those who work , and that work does not turn into punishment . " " Perhaps the most accessible form of freedom , the most subjectively enjoyed , and the most useful to human society , consists of being good at your job ... " . These statements are from The Wrench , where Faussone is good at his job and Levi is good at getting this across . There can be no doubt that he had an ear for what such people have to say for themselves . Faussone talks about " the way we bent our elbows " -- an expression ( for eating or drinking ) which I have heard spoken in English , but which I had never before seen written down in a book . Book-writers , Faussone says , produce works " which may be beautiful and all that , but , on the other hand , even if they were a bit defective , excuse the expression , nobody would die , and the only loser is the customer who bought them " . I have heard that before too , but not from any writer . A builder friend of mine once talked to me about mistakes made by builders . These mistakes mattered -- whereas " in the arts it does n't matter if you foul up . " Levi 's double life as chemist and writer suggests that if art and work need to be separated , according to a certain sense of what it is to be a Jew , art and work are nevertheless very often the same . I like to think that he would have accepted that art is work , that the work that frees us , and is not just " punishment " , is art , and that anyone who uses his imagination is an artist . The categorical difference of the modern world , between artists and others , does not come well out of his reports . His chemistry is intriguing from this point of view . Here was a second double life -- that of a scientist who was also an artist , a chemist who was also an alchemist , a businessman who was also a magician . He was as keen as mustard , and as Doctor Faustus . The Periodic Table reveals that the ancient magic of transmutation and alembics persisted in Levi 's laboratory . The book has fumes , stinks , bangs and fiascos . There is more than a hint of the search for the philosopher 's stone . It takes its structure from a set of correspondences between elements and persons , and the old definition of temperament as a mixture of qualities is present to the reader 's mind -- the same definition that permits us to think of Faussone as a part of Levi , or as his alter ego . Levi 's paints actually manage to come to life as human beings in The Wrench , a less fanciful book which nevertheless claims that " paints resemble us more than they do bricks . They 're born , they grow old , and they die like us ; and when they 're old , they can turn foolish , and even when they 're young , they can deceive you , and they 're actually capable of telling lies , pretending to be what they are n't : to be sick when they 're healthy , and healthy when they 're sick . " The work that Levi valued is of an order to which Auschwitz -- with the lying motto over its gates , Arbeit macht frei -- was built to be antithetical . In the camps , work was imposed on the prisoners with the aim of exploiting and of destroying them . It bore a hideous resemblance to the blighting , punishing sorts of work which are common in the world at large . And yet there was a work of survival to be attempted in the camps . Intelligence , vigilance , practicality , cunning , luck , friendship -- Levi was crucially helped by donations from an Italian workman he barely knew , and by the exercise of his skills as a chemist -- kept you going and , in some few cases , made you free . But most of those who stayed alive were " prominents " , or Kapos , prisoners who were placed in authority , or members of the Special Squads who assisted with the killings . One of the late pieces in The Drowned and the Saved casts doubt on this work of survival : " the worst survived " , he writes . In 1946 , a " religious friend " told him that he , Levi , belonged to an elect : " I , the non-believer , and even less of a believer after the season of Auschwitz , was a person touched by Grace , a saved man . " The friend felt Levi had survived " so that I could bear witness " . Levi goes on to insist that the real witnesses are those who died in the camps , and that those prisoners who did not were mostly compromised people or privileged people : Solzhenitsyn is cited as making the same point about the pridurki -- the " prominents " of the Gulag system . The book is no sequel to If this is a man , but its explications are never without interest . " In the Lager , colds and influenza were unknown , but one died , at times suddenly , from illnesses that the doctors never had an opportunity to study . Gastric ulcers and mental illnesses were healed ( or became asymptomatic ) but everyone suffered from an unceasing discomfort that polluted sleep and was nameless . " There is a chapter which discusses the letters from Germans -- " good Germans " in the main -- which were sent to him in response to his book about the camps . An eager public woman appealed to him with the story of her cleaning woman , who had proved herself at fault . The husband of the cleaning woman had been a soldier , and she had said that he had had no choice but to obey his orders to shoot Jews . The correspondent explained : " I discharged her , stifling the temptation to congratulate her on her poor husband fallen in the war . " There is a " Middle Eastern " recalcitrance here . Another chapter , on the Kapos and the Special Squads , exhibits what must surely be judged an analytic understanding of the concentration-camp system set up by the Nazis -- an understanding Eberstadt is inclined to deny him , believing that the camps are insufficiently construed in the Auschwitz book as an institutionalised anti-Semitism peculiar to Germany and politically-determined : she thinks it is soft of him to see them as belonging to a universal latent hostility to strangers . The chapter exposes a factor of complicity , and regards it , one might think , as a German invention . The Special Squads were the Nazis ' " most demonic crime " , representing " an attempt to shift on to others -- specifically the victims -- the burden of guilt , so that they were deprived even of the solace of innocence " . He never forgave the Nazis ; they were always his enemies . This was not , however , " personal " . He is among the least ego-bound of book-writers , the least ego-bound of autobiographers , at all times able to look beyond himself and his community . Two occasions in the book about his partisans quietly illustrate what he is for his readers in this respect . In the partisan book Line has been Leonid 's woman , and has gone with Mendel . By then a " desperate man " , Leonid is sent as such on a desperate mission , and is killed . Who can be said to have killed him ? Mendel tells Line : " The two of us . " Not long afterwards , his attention fixed on the sufferings of those Poles who had caused their Jews to suffer , Mendel falls silent , thinking : " Not only us . " For Fernanda Eberstadt , Mendel is " a worrier afflicted with an ability to see his enemy 's side of the question " . Those she does n't like are " cursed " or " afflicted " . There 's religion in that . Levi 's statement to Philip Roth about If not now , when ? did not mention Babel , but it did mention another Isaac -- the Yiddish writer , Bashevis Singer . There is a story of Singer 's -- one of a collection , The Death of Methuselah , published in Britain in the autumn of 1988 -- in which Levi , or a part or perception of Levi , is perhaps faintly distinguishable . " The Jew from Babylon " is an enthralling tale about a Jewish sorcerer , a believer in the faith , hated by demons and disapproved of by rabbis , who in old age endures a turmoil which ends his life . Singer is a writer of standing in the matter of when , in what he sees as the " disappointing " modern world , a Jew is not a Jew . Modern Jews , he affirms , are greedy creatures , tormented by their too many opinions . It could well be asked if his is an Orthodox fiction . Is it that of a vicarious believer , if such a person is possible ? Is he an aesthete of the subject ? Everything he writes is Jewish in the sense that everything he writes is conscious of the Jewish faith , if that can be said without relinquishing the thought that there are such persons as unbelieving Jews . But there is some instability in the accounts he gives of dark professions of faith , in his acerbities and fatalities . In one of the new stories a " recluse " , formerly a womaniser , says : " One step away from God and one is already in the dominion of Satan and hell . You do n't believe me , eh ? " Do we believe him ? Is this some Jewish joke ? Singer can , after all , be very funny . His religion is as much as anything the regression to a past of obedience , disobedience , sin and doom . Such things are celebrated in his stories with a richness and unction which might appear to make a renegade of Babel and certainly of Levi . Singer 's religion is also a feeling for the power of the community to censure and reject . This power is apparent in the story of his sorcerer . It is a story in which the case of Primo Levi , that of a dissident , gifted , magical , mustardly Jew , might at moments be thought to be implicated . But then so might that of the writer of the story , who may be less obedient than the gentile reader immediately recognises . The story celebrates both the sorcerer and his rejection . We mourn his fall . " In the morning they found him dead , face down on a bare spot , not far from the town . His head was buried in the sand , hands and feet spread out , as if he had fallen from a great height . " Glasgow Hamlet STUDYING the West Coast of Scotland from the yacht Britannia , the Queen is said to have remarked , not long ago , that the people there did n't seem to have much of a life . James Kelman 's stories make clear what life is like in Glasgow , and what James Kelman 's life is like . They are not going to change the royal mind . This is the queen who was greeted , on a visit to a Scottish university , by the sight of a student emptying down his throat , at top speed , the contents of a bottle of alcohol . One of Kelman 's stories , " Greyhound for Breakfast " , the last in the collection of that name which appeared in 1987 , is , to my mind , a masterpiece . It 's about a fellow called Ronnie , who is on the dole . His son has gone off to London , and he worries that he may lose touch with him . He has dumped down the notes for a greyhound , has given his heart to the beast , and is derided for this by his friends in the pub . He takes it for a walk -- such walks have long been a ritual activity of the country 's more optimistic male poor , the dog more expensively jacketed than the chap . " It stopped for a piss . Ronnie could have done with one himself but he would have got arrested . " Its withers will never win any of the races Ronnie had been telling himself about , and he is reluctant to return from this long , defeated , dark-thoughted walk to break the bad news or his adventure to his wife and daughters . The story is wonderfully funny and depressing . Ronnie , I think , could be held to be a precursor of P for Patrick Doyle in Kelman 's novel of 1989 , A Disaffection . Both works end on a possible return , on what might look like a bleak diminuendo but is really an anxiety state . There are important differences , though . Kelman stands much closer to the new hero , and more is made of what happens in that hero 's head . The new book is funny and depressing at considerable length , and there are moments when a wee terror comes of its expanded universe . A Disaffection is a problematical book -- because of this closeness : we learn very little about how Doyle is seen by companions , very little about the standpoint of those who surround him , those with whom he has his tender and abrasive dealings , with whom he airs his invectives and bitter ironies , with whom he conducts his antagonisms and ingratiations . It 's almost all Doyle . If this is a problem , however , it is one the novel shares with many of the novels we now read . We are aware , in the novels we read , both of an authorial identification with the leading character or the first-person narrator , and of material that might constitute an authorial judgement in that respect : but we do n't know what the verdict is . A Disaffection shares in that uncertainty , and in so doing acknowledges a connection with a certain whether-or-not that we meet with in the plays of Shakespeare . Doyle -- " Patrick " to his author -- is of the fantastic-depressive , angry-and-otherwise Scots-Irish clan . He is a schoolteacher , 29 years old -- the age of Christ at Calvary , whose name is often in his mouth , averse though he is to " deities " , and perhaps of Hamlet , whose words enter the novel . This Glasgow Hamlet is the latest in a long line of impersonations , and his soliloquies are the novel he inhabits , or most of it . Doyle 's greyhound is a pair of electricians ' pipes , which he lights upon , paints and plays , producing a doleful sound that soothes him -- it is like mumbling your mantra or telling your beads . He needs soothing . He has passed into crisis . He is lonely . His aged parents bore him ( " Are all parents boring ? " ) . His brother Gavin frets him , and he has a longing for Gavin 's wife , together with a more urgent one for a teacher at the school , Alison Houston , who could be felt to lead him on a bit but does n't want to have a " relationship " with him . With Doyle it 's " fucking " this and " fucking " that and the system this and the system that . He is against " Greatbritain " , with its aristocratic capitalists , its MI5 and its MI6 . Society is a stench . Shite is everywhere . Crassness is everywhere . He is a schlemiel of the subject . In such a setting , he believes , his work as a teacher can only be betrayed . His work as a teacher does n't involve much in the way of teaching . Homework is a thing of the past . His classes are soliloquies and Socratic teases in which his interest in Classical Antiquity , in Pythagoras and Heraclitus , and in H�lderlin , Hegel and Marx , and in James Hogg , is imparted to the young ones . He is the sort of Sixties dominie who used to inveigh in class against the system . His relationship with the kids is one between equals , but they also seem to expect him to be a wise man , and this is what he sometimes expects of himself . The kids are presented as decent and thoughtful , and there 's an Arcadian absence of the stress and violence which some might look for in a class where the teacher swears and free-associates , and throws up and bunks off into the bargain . If the Queen 's telescope had been able to reach into Patrick 's classroom , there would have been a surprise in store for her -- but not for Patrick , who at least affects to believe the story that Orwellian minders are peering at the punters from the screens of the punters ' television sets . Kelman makes Doyle charming , and it is impossible to read the book without gaining the sense of a fully-developed authorial fellow-feeling . Not that Doyle is n't taxing and maddening too . His consciousness delivers paranoid images of aggression and hostility . He is against racism and sexism , but is capable of reflecting : " He was in love with Alison Houston . And he wanted to grab a hold of her . " His crisis is precipitated by word of his transfer to another school ; he staggers towards resigning from the school he 's at , and maybe from the profession , and then bunks off for a long afternoon 's superlager , home-brew and whisky with his brother , who is on the dole , and two of his brother 's mates . Eventually , stone-cold-sober-seeming but perhaps too drunk to drive , he treks off through the dubs of a drizzle ( Thales said the world was made of water , the " primary element " , and he handni even been to Glasgow ) back to his bachelor 's tenement flat ( Coelebs still in search of a wife ) . On the way , he is chased , or fancies he is chased , by Police who hate him . Kelman projects Doyle 's state of mind virtually without framing or critique . The Queen will certainly need a glossary , but even then she may well be uncertain as to just how much Kelman likes his unlikely lad . This kind of thing has been said about Hamlet , to whom , as I say , Kelman alludes , and more than alludes . At one point , " all he sought was death " ; and the next paragraph has him aching to be " out of the road of trouble and strife and all things rotten and putrefied and shitey " . Later he reproves himself for an impulse to be rude to a " good auld guy " encountered during his terminal search for a bus , and we think of the prating " good old man " Polonius . And on the facing page he breathes some more of Shakespeare 's words : " To return to Gavin 's or not . Whether it is nobler . " Whether he is sober enough to go back and fetch his dilapidated car , or should soldier on , is the question here , or at any rate part of it . Hamlet kills his good old guy , as it happens . He makes mistakes and causes havoc , in pursuit of the right course . So does Doyle . A high point in the novel is the altercation and huff with Gavin and his mates which precedes this : about the long holidays teachers get , or do n't get , about the homework they withhold , and about the rights of weans -- children -- and the rights of parents . Patrick said : Do you know what I tell parents Arthur ? I tell them to go and fuck themselves . Patrick held both hands up in a gesture of peace , he smiled for a moment ; I 'm no trying to get at you personally but I just fucking feel that you cant expect the teacher to be the everything , the heavyweight boxing champion of the world . Arthur stared at him . Know what I mean , I 'm just being honest with ye . I do nt think ye should expect the teacher to do everything . If you want your weans to get homework then give it to them your tucking self . Gavin said : That actually sounds quite right-wing ye know . Well it 's meant to be the fucking opposite and it is the fucking opposite . Gavin nodded . Then : Gavin gazed at him , then laughed briefly . He looked at Pat but Pat looked away . Nor was Pat going to say anything further because he was fucking off home as soon as he swallowed what he had lying . There was no point sitting here yapping to a bunch of fucking prejudiced right-wing bastards . And Gavin turned on him once more : What d ' you mean ye deny ye get long holidays ? I deny I get long holidays , that 's what I mean . Back it up . What d ' you mean back it up ? Show me what you 're talking about ? Naw . You show me what you 're talking about . I think I know what Paddy means , said Davie . Good , tell me , replied Gavin . I think I know what you mean Paddy . Pat nodded . Ye do nt think ye get long holidays because when you 're off from the school you 're still doing other things connected with it , making up timetables and all that . Patrick nodded . By the end of it you 're no all that sure whether teachers get long holidays or no ( they do , though most of them have to work hard for it ) , and whether parents should go and fuck themselves . Soon after this we learn that Doyle thinks he has sold his rights by serving the system as a teacher for " a large wheen of pennies " : " He was an article that was corrupt ... corruptio optimi pessima ... " . This , as he recognises , is a form of self-praise . Throughout , Patrick is both the " King of the World " that he wants to be -- Glasgow belongs to him -- and an abject sinner . The rage of the novel 's males can sometimes be made to appear the rage of those who believe themselves permanently beaten and cheated . The women are the vessels of a better spirit ; the injury to them is greater , and it is their own men who are responsible for some of that injury . Patrick rages and scorns in proportion to his frustration : Hamlet 's " weakness " has its counterpart here . " Patrick couldni find a pen . It is most odd indeed how objects disappear in rooms wherein the only moveable entity is oneself . " ( He slides into English here for a laugh . ) Objects disappear , and for a man of 29 he seems to have grabbed hold of very little of anything except a glass and a book . Drink figures in the novel , in precisely rendered scenes , as a bastion of the culture which is also a slow death . And yet this man is very far from useless . What we are reading is the Book of Patrick Doyle . Whether or not it can be seen as Kelman 's self-portrait , it is the portrait of an artist . The shortest stories in Greyhound for Breakfast owe a lot to Kafka 's briefer parables , though they are apt to be more difficult to understand ; and there can be no doubt that Beckett 's solipsistic tramps have left an impression on the earlier writings . These influences , however , would appear to have receded , or to have been digested . The speech of Glasgow people is the big thing in the novel . This is a good Scots which is at once distinctly literary and faithful to the speech of the city . The deferred " but " as in " There again but " is a particular pleasure . There are many such verbatim effects , and indeed the oral dimension of the novel is very important . This can be reckoned to contain the succession of anecdotes that occurs and the fine detail of working-class life that is provided . Doyle , for instance , thinks to himself a Scottish thought : " Would his grandparents ever have had sexual activity in the parlour ? " Elsewhere , " he put a teaspoonful-and-a-half of coffee granules into his mug and exactly the same into hers . " The measure expresses a mean between saving and lashing-out , and it has remained a feature of my own Scots-Irish domestic economy which I would bet is widespread in northern parts . There is good Scots , too , in The Book of Sandy Stewart , which contrasts poignantly with the Book of Patrick Doyle . Stewart is a traveller , one of the people of the road -- among them , tinkers , pipers and folk-singers -- in whom an oral culture has survived to the present day . Here , too , there is an antiquity to be aware of . The book is a succession of anecdotes carefully transcribed in fidelity to his broad Scots , and largely concerned with the long-since of his early days . A story that would appeal to Kelman concerns some killer donkeys . One of these creatures once slew a butler whose toff gear had proved a red rag -- quite a smack , this , at the system . This gentleman bocht the donkey fae MacGreigor -- it was afore my day though -- an it wes two or three days in the field at the front door . This day the butler went oot tae gie it a piece an it tore him doon wae its feets an mooth . They say that it wes the different claes that done it -- the way the butler dressed -- an it hed looked at the claes an taen a bad wey o the claes . It hed run intae him an tore him at yinst . An they say the butler wes gaithert up intae a white sheet aff the field . Kelman 's work forms part of a flowering of talent which has come about in the urban Scotland of the last few years . These books and plays and films reveal a humanity which surmounts , as has been said , the hardship and brutality they describe -- surmounts it , as a rule , by laughing at it . The Glasgow they evoke is a very hard and a very lively place . And yet Stewart 's small wandering world could well be thought the richer of the two environments . He seldom responds to matters of personality , or individual psychology , is hardly ever in the least " inward " ; much depends on the turn of the tale . They are tales , moreover , which do n't do all that much to summon the nostalgic reader . They do n't direct us to the late survival of a gypsy paradise . Nevertheless , they contain persuasive evidence to indicate that there was more for his people to do , and talk about , that there was more fun , than there is now in some parts of urban Scotland . Less persuasively , a people which has had to defend itself against an enduring hostility is shown , for the most part , as free from fear , and , in particular , from the fear that exceeds and mistakes its objects . Those under threat in the cities have not always been so lucky . But then the travellers , too , may not have been quite as lucky as Stewart , in his old age , can sometimes suggest . I remember these nomads myself , from a long while ago in Scotland . I remember dark , solemn and suspicious looks , as a travelling family was given tea in the back-garden of a house in the country . I peered at them round the end of the house . They could not be let into it , but there was a duty to entertain them , and , as I was told , not to stare . They were like spirits , and I loved them . <text id="bnc:7">So you want to be an Actor ? Everyone who wants to act professionally should try to see as much drama as they possibly can -- and this means in the broadest sense , watching television , cinema , visiting the theatre and looking at the actor 's work carefully and analytically . It is also important that you try and evaluate the dramatic experience of these different forms of presentation -- this is worthwhile , because it will make you think about the different ways in which an actor can work and the various ways in which his skills are used . Clearly , there is a difference in scale and dimension between the stage , the television screen and the cinema screen , which demand changes in direction and in acting technique . One of the things you will notice when watching the television is that close-ups are used very effectively , and so it is of vital importance that the actor has absolute control over his/ her face and expression . You should also look at the ways in which the physical movements of the actor are organised to suit the restraints of the small screen . When we turn to the theatre the question of scale is also significant . The theatre is " larger than life " , not in terms of physical scale , but because movements and speech are comparatively emphatic and intense , even when a play simulates everyday natural surroundings . Some people find this makes theatre less " believable " -- less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained performances seen on television and cinema . Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage -- the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on . As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself , and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for . Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters -- this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the audience into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively ) . It is also used as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwrights . The film is a very distinct dramatic medium . As you become interested in film acting it is likely that you will also become interested in film making , for the actor 's work depends so much on the technical decisions of the director and editor . A film is made up of a series of shots that may be photographed over various periods of time ; a " take " that may have originally started out as three or four minutes in length may eventually be edited to a ten second shot . The film is therefore built up in pieces , a process which makes particular demands of an actor -- who is also vulnerable to technical problems with cameras , lighting and editing in a way which is quite removed from the stage actor 's experience . All in all , it 's more difficult to evaluate an actor 's work on screen , particularly as actors are usually cast in a film for their total credibility in a role and the camera work is such an intrinsic part of the final effect . So , what can you learn from looking so closely at the actor on stage , TV and cinema ? In the first place you will start to think about how an actor 's work differs according to the demands of the medium . And you will become aware of technical skills -- noticing economy of effect and style , seeing and hearing how an actor interprets a script , and how his thinking comes across in a performance . Of course , if an actor is doing his/ her work well , you will have to work really hard to notice all these things -- for the effect will be seamless . Reading It 's very important that you read widely , both novels and playscripts , and do n't just confine yourself to an exam syllabus . After all , an actor 's life is spent working with words , and it will be valuable for you to have a reasonable background in the English literary and dramatic traditions . Novels have been a rich source of material for the film industry since the talkies were introduced , and it 's very interesting to see how both classic and contemporary novels require skilled adaptation of the dialogue to make sufficient dramatic impact in a film . As you read you will probably be aware of a character 's potential as a role for the actor -- particularly with those who have already an established place in theatrical tradition ( Dickens is full of such characters ) . Reading plays is an essential part of your career preparation -- the more plays you read the more you will understand of the theatre 's development . Academic study of drama as such is not necessarily useful for the actor , but an awareness of playwrights and their various styles is of practical value . A play is primary a piece of action and although a script contains some scenic and character description , the essential interest lies in the dialogue and the action arising from it . A play really demands to be read aloud -it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive . It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage . Surprisingly , this is true of both the classical and modern play , though you might expect that the obscurities and difficulties of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in , say , Shakespeare or Ben Jonson . Here is a suggested first reading list , which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's development . There is a danger in reading the classics , in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature -- so always try to look at them as plays for performance -- and , it goes without saying , try to see as much theatre as you can . It 's worthwhile reading some pre-Shakespearean drama ; you could read Everyman , a great morality play of the late Middle Ages , and Gammer Gurton 's Needle , first performed in 1566 and thought to be the second oldest English comedy . You should try to read as much as you can of the great Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists ; Shakespeare , Marlowe and Ben Jonson , Beaumont and Fletcher , Tourneur , Webster , Middleton . Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream and Hamlet would be a good starting point -- As You Like It , Twelfth Night and Julius Caesar you may already be familiar with , as they are often set for O level courses . Marlowe 's Dr Faustus and Ben Jonson 's Volpone and The Alchemist are frequently revived . You might well enjoy Beaumont and Fletcher 's rumbustious The Knight of the Burning Pestle -- The Maid 's Tragedy is a good choice , too . The Jacobean dramatists created a world of passion and violence " vividly theatrical . Two of the best plays to read from this period are Tourneur 's The Revenger 's Tragedy , and Webster 's The White Devil . Theatres were closed during the Cromwellian period , but with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 came Court comedy and the beginning of the " comedy of manners " which has , in one way or another , been popular right up to the present day . William Congreve 's Love for Love and The Way of the World are highly decorated in language , and sharp in wit ; to compare with these , you could look at William Wycherley 's more " basic " comedy , The Country Wife . Perhaps the most " modern " of the Restoration writers is George Farquhar ; period artifice is not so obtrusive in his plays , the best known of which are The Recruiting Officer and The Beaux Stratagem . It would also be a good idea to read something by the French dramatist , Moli�re , their great contemporary , who satirises the hypocrisies of cultivated society ; I recommend Tartuffe about a religious imposter and La Malade Imaginaire , a satire on the medical profession . Sheridan and Goldsmith continued to write comedies of manners during the eighteenth century " with their famous plays The Rivals and She Stoops to Conquer , and this tradition finds its most successful twentieth-century exponents in Noel Coward and Somerset Maugham ; Private Lives and The Circle are frequently revived by present day repertory companies . Have a look at these . The nineteenth century was , by and large , an unexciting time for theatre writing , until the end of the century when Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw make their entry . Wilde 's The Importance of Being Earnest is a must and of the large Shavian canon I suggest you read St Joan and The Doctor 's Dilemma or Major Barbara to get a clear idea of his style and the kind of demands he makes of actors verbally . The most vital explosion of British theatre writing since the Second World War came with the foundation of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre in London , under the direction of George Devine : the first season mounted there included John Osborne 's Look Back in Anger . Arnold Wesker 's famous trilogy of plays Chicken Soup with Barley , Roots and I 'm Talking About Jerusalem was also performed at the Royal Court . You should be aware of this period and I recommend reading all four plays and also The Theatre of George Devine by Irving Wardle . Harold Pinter occupies a unique place in contemporary theatre as a distinctive stylist , and I suggest you read some of his early short plays like The Room and The Dumb Waiter before going on to his major plays like The Birthday Party and The Caretaker . Two of the most outstanding of recent playwrights are David Hare and Tom Stoppard , and I have included extracts from their work in the audition piece selections , p 31 . I recommend that you read Hare 's trilogy The History Plays , which include Knuckle , Licking Hitler and Plenty -- and perhaps his earlier play Teeth 'n ' Smiles . Stoppard 's most popular play is probably still Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead , and he has had notable success with Jumpers , Travesties , and , more recently , The Real Thing . Two other contemporary writers whose work was first performed by the English Stage Company are Nigel Williams , author of Sugar n ' Spice and Paul Kember , author of Not Quite Jerusalem ( which has recently been filmed ) . It 's worth reading these two plays . And you should also read Steven Berkoff , a high stylist and writer of abrasive poetic theatre , who stands quite alone . Look at East , Greek and Decadence . I have n't yet mentioned the development of the Theatre of the Absurd , which has been a strong force in European drama since Alfred Jarry 's Ubu Roi was first performed in 1896 . Read Ubu , and you can see the connections with Samuel Beckett 's Waiting for Godot , and Ionesco 's The Chairs and The Bald Prima Donna . Martin Esslin 's book The Theatre of the Absurd is a very valuable background on this subject . Of the British playwrights , Pinter is often thought to be on the edges of " absurdism " and you could also read N. F. Simpson 's One Way Pendulum and Cresta Run . All of these recommendations , however , are only to give you a first taste of the scope of theatrical writing . You should read as much as you can of European and American drama , both historical and contemporary , for by doing so you will certainly set yourself up well for both drama school training and your subsequent acting career . Approach to drama training One of the questions you may be asking yourself is " Can I be taught to act ? " This is something everyone wonders when starting out , even if they are not intending to make a living out of acting . The answer is , of course , no . No-one can actually teach anyone to act . That has something to do with the indefinable thing called talent . You either have it or you do not -- talent is certainly not something which can be taught . But talent can be developed and trained and provide a sound basis for you to give of the best there is inside you . So at this moment it 's as well to look at your present experience and see how you can help yourself to extend it , before applying to audition at a drama school . First training opportunities Your local amateur society is always a good beginning . Being nervous and taking risks are two of the main things you will have to face as an aspiring actor , and that first time you read a play with a group of strangers , rather than in a classroom or among friends is when you confront your first hurdle . But you may not actually learn much , simply because the main object of the group will not be to help you but to get on and do the play , relying on the skills available and hoping that the audience will give adequate support . So what else can you do ? In recent years the amateur actor has had more opportunity for classes in theatre work , including voice and movement training as well as performance and directing skills . These facilities differ in all parts of the world , but in Britain the evening class is probably the most accessible form of training . London is obviously where most of the opportunities abound . Notable here are the courses offered during both day and evening by the City Literary Institute . Classes at the " City Lit " , as it is affectionately known , are handled by a highly competent team of tutors , many of whom teach at the drama schools too . There are classes in movement , dance , acting and improvisation , as well as more specialist areas like mime , clowning , and playwriting . The classes are on certain days of the week only , but enrolment is not expensive given that a term is structured over the usual academic year . The term can be approximately twelve to thirteen weeks long , and advanced classes will in all probability do a production over that time which will be mounted and produced in the Institute 's own theatre . Such an exercise might even spread over two or three terms . What should you do if you do n't live in London , and find that it is financially difficult to pay for such courses ? The best way to find out about what is available to you more locally is to contact your County Drama Adviser and also the Regional Arts Association for your area , who will have details about part-time training for young actors ( see Appendix A ) . Amateur theatre flourishes almost everywhere , and when you 're beginning it can not be stressed too strongly that it is desirable to obtain some actual stage experience before jumping into the big pool of drama school , or even summer school . Once again , the Regional Arts Association will know the leading amateur companies in your area , and this should certainly help you in looking for the kind of group to which you are best suited . The British Theatre Association , mentioned in the first edition of this book , has for decades offered professional and all-embracing training courses for actors , directors , and young people . It is currently , in 1990 , fighting for its life . Due to lack of governmental or any other official support this unique and valuable organisation has had to suspend its training activities temporarily , whilst trying to secure for itself a sound and permanent financial basis for the future . It is hoped that courses on a limited basis may restart in the Autumn of 1990 . Meanwhile , the BTA is still the custodian of the finest theatre library in Europe . It would be a tragic loss to theatre if such an important organisation were to go to the wall . It 's been the cradle and help of many actors , directors and playwrights . The summer school The summer schools or workshops offered by the drama schools last approximately five weeks , and give a clear idea of what full-time drama training involves . And one of the main advantages of these very compressed and arduous courses is that they give students approaching drama school entry an opportunity of seeing what will be required of them should they gain a place at drama school . The workshops run daily from 9.30 a. m. to 5.00 p. m . ( Monday to Friday ) , giving a taste of the kind of stamina that will ultimately be required over a much longer period . ( At drama school the full-time course will frequently require the student to work until 9 p. m. and later when productions are being mounted . ) Because summer schools generate enormous interest overseas , there is nearly always a strong emphasis on the classical theatre , usually on Shakespeare , and there will quite probably be classes on classical texts and mini-production exercises arising from these . You may find yourself doing quite a bit of " line learning " . The daily schedule can be something like this : 9 a. m . Movement/ dance 10 a. m . Voice/ Speech class where students try out their own interpretations Noon Improvisation 1 p. m . Lunch 2 p. m . Make-up class 3 p. m . Rehearsal of course project 5.30 p. m . End of classes for the day The five weeks is structured to provide a fairly comprehensive picture of actor training though even so it can only provide an outline of classes at drama school . There is not much time for academic work , though some courses include lectures on theatre history . Some of the courses include a limited number of visits to the theatre , and discussion of these productions will be included in the overall schedule . But acting and all that it means is very much a doing thing , so the emphasis is always on practical work . Anyone can participate in summer schools , as no auditions are required , only completion of an application form . But often students attending do have previous experience , either in the amateur theatre " or in university or school productions . On the whole there is no real age limit , and the level of experience can be very mixed . Classes are led by experienced staff , usually by staff at the drama school where the course is held , and at the end of the five weeks groups will present mini-production projects to each other , on which they will be assessed , and they will usually be given a certificate for having attended the course . In some cases students wishing to take an open audition for the full-time course may do so without paying the usual audition fee . The cost of training at a summer school over a five-week period will vary with the different establishments , but the overall fee is likely to be around �700 ( 1990 prices ) , for all students , whether from Britain or overseas . For details about applying to summer schools , see Appendix C on p 134 . Going to drama school Vocational training for the actor as we know it has only existed in England for the last eighty years . The starting point was the formation by Sir Herbert Tree of a training school at His Majesty 's Theatre , London , in 1904 . The school later moved to Gower St , was granted a royal patent , and eventually became the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art . Eighty years does n't seem a very long time when you consider the art of acting has been prospering in Europe over the last four hundred or so years , quite apart from the great traditions of ancient Greek drama . But it is certainly true that in the last sixty years the various schools and academies of acting have had a significant effect on the climate of acting . It 's significant , too , that while Herbert Tree was laying the foundations of drama training in England , the famous partnership of Stanislavsky and Danchenko in Russia was beginning , and saw the first developments towards the establishment of the Moscow Arts Theatre . Stanislavsky 's ideas on acting became central to modern drama training , and many of the most interesting and powerful concepts in actor training developed from his work . Choosing your course Most people applying to drama school will be seeking to enrol on the full-time diploma course , which usually runs over a three-year period . The average age of entry for the diploma course is between 18 and 20 , though some schools accept entrants as young as 17 , others students up to 30 : age between these limits is not likely to be a problem provided the candidate shows talent , flexibility and motivation . Some schools offer a two-year course for students who have more experience , particularly those from overseas . Two-year course students may be a little older , and have already studied drama at university level . A limited number of schools offer post-graduate courses which are scheduled over one year . LAMDA ( London Academy of Music and Drama ) runs a one-year course for overseas students only , which although not set up as a post-graduate course may include a number of students with extensive university theatre experience as well as some professional experience . Drama Studio London also runs a one-year course for post-graduate students or in some cases students with other professional skills or theatrical experience . Obviously , sorting out the courses which are on offer can best be done by writing for the prospectus but with any application the question that will be of overriding importance is how you are going to finance your training . Payment of fees and grants Fees set by each drama school do differ slightly , though they can be considered basically similar . In general , it 's wise to think of each term 's tuition fees as costing from �1300 to �1600 ( prices current in 1989/ 90 ) . Expect a general rise in fees of some 7-9 % for the academic year starting September 1990 . For an eight-term diploma course the total cost will be around �11-12000 . These fees are quite distinct from the money you will need for living , travelling , buying books , etc. , which will probably account for a further �3500 to �5000 ( these figures are based on 1989/ 90 standards ) . Three-year and two-year diploma students should bear these figure in mind so they have some idea of what is going to be involved when they make an application for a further education grant to their local authority . Application for a grant should be made at the same time as the application for an audition in order that you can be sure of your position should you be fortunate enough to be offered a place . It is true that some local authorities will not say whether you are eligible or not until a place has been put on offer to you , but it 's still very much worth your while to find out all you can from your local education authority . Discretionary grants for further education have suffered in the climate of recent economic cuts and local government spending allowances can affect the number and level of grants awarded . Generally , a local authority will aim to cover the full cost of fees and a living allowance " although this can be subject to your personal circumstances and will vary depending on whether you will live with your parents during term time , or in rented accommodation . It is possible that your local authority may ask you to audition for them after you have been offered a place . This seems an odd way of going about things , but the advising panels do carry a professional adviser so that talent is not merely being judged by local civil servants . The object of this rather clumsy piece of administration is to place some check on the expenditure of local money on the arts -- and also to provide a further checkpoint on students who have already received educational grants for other careers . Having worked on interview panels with the now defunct ILEA I can say that the object has not been to block the drama school selection so much as to see that the grant is well justified . Scholarships are an entirely different matter . Some schools do provide for students to be granted a scholarship towards the cost of tuition , but there are not many endowments of this kind . RADA offers two to three scholarships per year for UK students , Webber Douglas offers two , RSAMD offer a small number of scholarships and Guildford School of Acting offers one to an acting student , for fees only . LAMDA have a small number of awards " some of which can give financial assistance . Two scholarships are available for American students at RADA , which provide the total fee , or , according to parental income , part of it . Drama schools in Britain There are seventeen drama schools in Britain which constitute the " Conference of Drama Schools " and most of these have courses which have been accredited by the National Council for Drama Training . This means they have been inspected by a team of professional experts and the standard of their work has been approved . Drama training is under constant review through the accreditation system , so that standards are maintained and new developments assessed , and schools which may not be in the accredited list today may well be there soon . Any potential student will naturally wish to see what is offered by the different drama schools and a concise summary of the aims and policies of the seventeen main schools can be found in Appendix B on p 119 . There are , of course , many schools other than those listed in the appendix , and also a great many private coaches , all of whom may be found in the publication Contacts , a trade book everyone interested in joining the profession should obtain from the office of The Spotlight , 42-43 Cranbourn St , London WC2H 7AP . In the 1984 edition a further one hundred and thirty-four addresses were listed , which includes ballet schools , mime tuition courses , and others . There are still those who prefer to take their chances in the profession without any formal training . This used to be a lot easier to do than it is now : for one thing , working in the profession means that you have to belong to the actors ' union , Equity . Yet students who have completed expensive training face the same difficulties as an untrained actor in qualifying for an Equity card . This question is discussed later in the book , but it is still relevant to the potential drama student . Becoming an actor has to be thought of in realistic terms right from the beginning and all possible problems do need to be faced . The post-graduate course The post-graduate course is not offered by all drama schools , and places are therefore limited . As far as grants are concerned , students who apply for a place are almost certain to have used at least three years ' worth of their local authority grant entitlement while studying at university or polytechnic , and may only be eligible for a further one-year entitlement if they have been accepted at a drama school . And it has been said that local authorities are not always very sympathetic to acting as a choice of career and sometimes obtaining a grant may be more difficult if a student has evidently changed his or her career tack . The case of a physics teacher who wanted to become an actor is interesting in showing the kind of problems which accompany a late entry into drama school . The local authority to which he applied refused to provide the necessary grant , and the person was sadly compelled to turn down a place on a one-year post-graduate course which had already been offered to him . The grounds were that he had used up his grant entitlement in qualifying to be a teacher . The three or four terms offered to post-graduate students condense the technical work of a three-year course ; on the whole there is greater emphasis on training the voice , movement , acting technique , fencing and dance , etc. since students will presumably have developed a fair amount of performing skill through their university drama departments or societies . This means that there is usually only one " show-case " production at the end of the year for agent and production managements to see . The one-year course is only to lay down the foundations of good technical training -- and it is widely recognised that the course simply pushes the student into the profession with enough practical experience to find his or her feet . There is an optional second year which students can apply for which " joins up " with the two-year diploma course . Students do n't automatically proceed to this -- it depends on the talent of the individual concerned , and of course it means that an extra year 's funds have to be found . There is really no way of knowing how long it takes to develop an actor who has already gained a lot from work in university . University acting can be very good and technically aware , or it can be immensely self-indulgent and over-academic , full of theory and sparse on craft . That is why the post-graduate course exists -- to shape intellect and enthusiasm and provide practical and professional skills . The overseas student All major drama schools audition in the USA , and offer places to students who can show talent and raise the money to accept a place . This is one field of higher education where in some cases the fees from the overseas student are no higher than they are for British nationals . In all cases students taking a course ( which is usually either a two-year diploma course or a one-year course ) are expected to return to their country on completion of training . Students can also apply from any part of the world , and audition in the UK , but need to remember that a high standard of fluency in the English language will be expected . There will always be problems when working with an English vernacular text using cockney or other dialects , but students from overseas have to expect to take this in their stride ( and usually do ) . Undoubtedly one of the best ways the overseas student has of seeing what is required in British theatre training is to apply for one of the summer schools offered by the drama schools , and find out what it 's all about before committing him- or herself to a long and expensive stay . It 's important that a student is prepared to understand and work with the prevalent theatrical traditions in UK schools . And with so much theatre training available in the United States , New Zealand , Australia and Canada , it is interesting to ask why British theatre training is thought to be so beneficial . I can only put it down to the strong classical emphasis which prevails in the courses offered in the UK , although many of the university drama courses in the USA do stage Shakespeare and the European classical authors . America has had many unsuccessful attempts to form a national repertory theatre , performing the classics of the English language , and one wonders whether it will ever be possible to get this going effectively . It 's often thought that previous attempts have failed because there are n't enough well-trained classical actors in the USA to make such a repertory company feasible , but this is increasingly not the case : American drama students are eager to train in the UK , and the percentage of successful auditions held is relatively high . In Great Britain the ear becomes accustomed to the native British voice handling the classical text , but this really should not hinder American actors ; they need not become totally " accentless " in order to play classical verse . Instead they need to find out the rhythms of speech which make the music of the verse work in dramatic form . Many American students working in British drama schools find the answer to this question by using what is called " standard American " , and this approach is being used now in training on both sides of the Atlantic . The drama school audition By now you will have made a definite decision to become an actor -- no matter what the problems or obstacles . The next step is to prepare for the audition at a drama school and find the right kind of textual material which will allow you to show the best of yourself . On obtaining a prospectus and asking for an application form , you will find that every drama school will require an audition fee , and this can vary between �15 and �25 . If you can afford to , it 's generally best to spread your auditions around the drama schools so that you are seen more than once . When auditioning for most schools you will be asked to present at least two contrasting speeches and possibly give some idea of your attitude to improvisation and , perhaps , to singing . It 's usual to make a choice from the classical and modern repertoire . Some schools will stipulate a number of Shakespearean speeches from which you may select , but in the main the choice of work is left entirely to you . Your choice of material A lot will depend on your current theatre experience and whether you have done much acting , but finding the right kind of character to work in an audition is going to mean some careful thinking and planning . Always think what the chosen piece is doing for you -- after all , the audition is about you , the naked ape , as well as that inner spark of inspiration you may have . Your bones , your eyes , your hair , your teeth are all going to be scrutinised by a panel of judges who are looking for your all-round potential , not just an impressive academic display . Acting is very much a physical business . Remember that there may be some twelve to eighteen places at any one of the drama schools , and the number of auditions may number up to fifteen hundred for the leading schools . Do n't be daunted by that , but recognise that like everything else in the acting business , it is highly competitive . No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates should possess a noticeable degree of competence and self-awareness . Not all auditions have just two speeches , classical and modern . You may well be asked to sing something unaccompanied , or do a short improvisation and you may well be asked to perform one of the speeches in a different way . In some schools you will be asked to participate with other students in basic class work over a weekend ( as happens at the Bristol Old Vic drama school ) and in some you may find yourself being judged partly by senior students of the school who will be sitting with the faculty panel ( which is something that happens at Drama Centre ) . The point of preparation is to be well tuned and at the same time flexible to new interpretations and ideas . Rigidity of approach is something to be avoided at all costs -- there is no point in being able to do a " party piece " one way and be unable to take in new direction on the same material . Everyone on the audition panel is prepared to be on your side and supportive . They are not looking for you to fail -- every audition panel wants you to be good . That 's why there are contrasting pieces ; not everyone is going to be marvellous with the classics ( Rex Harrison once avowed that he was " no good at Tudor verse speaking " ) . But you are expected to be competent with such material even if you feel this is not what you would eventually choose to work with . The classical text is for the panel to see your present abilities , your imaginative range and your capacity as a thinking actor . And while you are not expected to be perfect ( who is , ever ? ) you are expected to have something to offer . The classical audition Shakespeare is the most widely known and read of the classical playwrights and it is for this reason that a piece from one of his plays is nearly always obligatory at a drama school audition . This is not simply to force people into speaking blank verse , but to see how a person responds to the essential humanity of a character -- for Shakespeare , of all the classical writers , is probably the most human , whose work is blessed with both grandeur and the common touch . The plays are full of characters that soliloquise -- that is , speak solo without other characters around them , thinking aloud about their aims , their problems , their ambitions , loves and hatreds . These soliloquies occupy a unique area of dramatic speech ( although the solo aria is something modern dramatists are now using more frequently ) . There are a host of audition pieces to be derived from the soliloquies and monologues , many of which are well tried favourites , and almost any selection will be reasonably well known . But when you are looking for a suitable speech you ca n't really reject anything familiar solely because you think it might bore the panel . It 's true that extracts such as Phoebe 's " Think not that I love him ... " from As You Like It ( Act 3 , Scene 5 ) or Viola 's " 1 left no ring with her ... " from Twelfth Night ( Act 2 , Scene 2 ) may be all too well known to a panel , but I can not agree with an adjudication policy that would ban these pieces from the audition . The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student , and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece . The most important thing is your firm knowledge that the selection is within your present range . It 's not much use arriving somewhere at ten in the morning clutching the collected works under your arm and wishing you had a wig and been born thirty years earlier in order to play Lear -- or for that matter the Duke of Gloucester . Major roles for older women are not so common in Shakespeare , but I think it is better not to choose a character such as Queen Katherine from Henry VIII , who needs a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic interest . If you do want to portray an older figure , it would be preferable to try Hermione in The Winter 's Tale -- she is a more fantastical character , without the added complications of historical authenticity , and so allows for greater flexibility of characterisation . Her trial scene ( Act 3 , Scene 2 ) which begins Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation ... is a familiar but effective choice . In Shakespeare there are many young men to choose from . Romeo is a good choice , and there are many speeches to look over and consider , but think also about the not so familiar young lover Troilus ; Bassanio , Lorenzo and Graziano , from the Merchant of Venice all make good choices too . And of course there is Petruchio , lively in humour and making a confidante of his listeners . All of them have speeches that are rich in passion , character and intensity , which can sustain the actor in solo flight . The point is that they are all vital young men with love on their minds , full of colourful words to express their feelings , and all are within the range of the eighteen to twenty-five year old student actor . And then there are the tougher types : Edmund from King Lear , a romantic macho figure with a wide eye for fame and fortune . You might also think about that other bastard son , Philip , in King John , a merry , pranking , politically astute fellow , with a wry , salty style . He has a famous eulogy on status : A foot of honour better than I was But many a foot of land the worse ... Act 1 , Scene 1 Much in the same vein is Henry V who has several well known " set " speeches , full of fireworks , as well as the difficult and testing soliloquy on the responsibility of leadership that begins " Upon the King ... " ( Act 4 , Scene 2 ) . This is a major meditative speech brooding on the loneliness of the man caught between action and passivity -- thinking aloud in much the same way as Hamlet does in his many renowned arias on the soul and the theme of revenge . And remember there is no need to be afraid of Hamlet . He is , after all , an actor 's part and perfectly accessible -- he prefers , too , to be acted rather than to be read . Years of scholarship and so many contentious performances mean that the character is now regarded as " difficult " , when it can in fact benefit from the freshness and vitality of the natural actor , who will quickly find the comic qualities of the man as well as his serious side . Ophelia is often ignored for audition material simply because she does n't seem to have much in the way of a sustained speech until she goes mad . Yet her earlier speech , where she describes Hamlet 's condition and behaviour , has great tenderness and awareness : He took me by the wrist , and held me hard , Then goes he to the length of all his arm , And , with his other hand thus o'er his brow , He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it ... Act 2 , Scene 1 The speech is short but very telling and can be effective in a solo audition , even though the actual scene does involve other characters . The question of selection is very personal ; after all , what makes you choose the character that you are going to do ? There must be some affinity between you and the man or woman on the printed page -- something that you recognise not because you are " just like that " but because you feel that you can interpret the situation with those words . Let us look at Romeo and Juliet . One thing you can be sure of is that the panel will know the words of these characters very well ( they will probably be able to prompt you at any given moment should you " dry " ) but each and every time the lines are spoken by a new voice they are different in their texture , humour , drama and music . Bernard Shaw once described Romeo and Juliet as " the impetuous march of music " , and if ever there was a play of rich language , this is it . The music of the words is there to be used -- but not at the expense of the sense and emotional content . Although every moment of the lovers ' experience is drenched in imagery , there is still a fine feeling of reality about the characters which gives them bone and muscle . Yet it is not the reality of a naturalistic drama , such as we would find in , say , Ibsen or Chekhov . We can not explain the motivations of Romeo in terms of today 's values , but we can bring a contemporary handling to the words that will make the imagery blaze afresh each time it is spoken . You will find the speeches scattered like jewels throughout the text , but it is perhaps as well to keep to the simpler ones for your audition piece -- those where Romeo and Juliet are directly enthralled by love and the declaration of love to another person . These are better than the poison-taking and tomb scenes . In any case , keep your chosen speech short and contained , for it is better to end when those auditioning would have you continue . Brevity truly is the soul of wit . Reading around for background to Shakespeare is valuable , and you ca n't do better than begin with the Harley Granville Barker 's Prefaces to Shakespeare , which analyse the plays from both a scholarly and dramatic angle , without being ponderously academic . John Barton 's Playing Shakespeare is a fine follow-up . Barton does investigate the actor 's work in a more contemporary way and the book is based on the TV series of the same name . The modern audition Selections from the modern theatre may include characters that have been created over the last sixty years , from Noel Coward to Steven Berkoff . Which is a very big range . Interestingly , though , most of the audition selections are chosen from work of the last twenty years ; most young students will go for contemporary work . Therefore the pieces that have been put together in the following pages as possible audition selections are from writers who have gained , or are now gaining , a major place in contemporary theatre . In my suggested audition pieces , I have not included any of the well known speeches from such modern classics as Look Back in Anger , by John Osborne , or Roots , by Arnold Wesker although these plays are revived frequently in many theatres . Neither have I suggested anything from Noel Coward , Somerset Maugham or Terence Rattigan , even though their plays are continually being performed . The technique required in presenting characters from these plays is usually more delicate than can be achieved in a first audition , whereas the work of Tom Stoppard , David Hare and Barry Keefe ( for example ) is more easily grasped by the young actor . Finding characters for yourself will , 1 think , depend a good deal on your personal taste in theatre at the time you are auditioning . And your choice of audition piece is often largely decided by the contrast it provides with the classical selection you have made . The question of accent is important too -- you need to be confident of the accent with which you are working , and it is always advisable to present an accent you are familiar with or at least can work with comfortably . The first piece of advice that 's necessary is that you should n't just try to be fashionable by choosing juicy speeches that catch your eye without knowing the whole play and having a working idea of how to perform the speech . And do n't let your search for material lead you to choose the obscure for obscurity 's sake , so you feel you will be sure to stun the panel with a piece that has no good professional background . Similarly , extracts from Agatha Christie or general run of the mill commercial theatre very rarely have enough substance on which you can work . A piece to be presented should have something more than a surface narrative quality in the characterisation . Writers such as C. P. Taylor , David Halliwell , Peter Nicols , Caryl Churchill and Louise Page have a great deal to offer . But there are many more , of course , and listing playwrights is useful only insofar as it presents a few guidelines , primarily to help you look in the right places . There are also many opportunities for audition pieces in the American repertoire . Arthur 's Miller 's plays such as All My Sons and Death of a Salesman are now regarded as virtual classics , and so are Tennessee William 's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire . American theatre is well known and well regarded here , and to choose a piece from any of those just mentioned is thoroughly viable . Sam Shepard and Edward Albee are also good choices , and there are interesting selections to be made from the play of the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , by Dale Wasserman . One of the most electric and abrasive of contemporary dramatists is Steven Berkoff , who uses big classical rhythms in his work , which calls for the sustaining power of " total " theatre , rather than naturalistic treatment . Berkoff demands high technical skill , but is wide open to raw interpretations , and as such offers a lot to the auditioning student . If you try him I suggest you select from Greek or East rather than , say , the more recent Decadence : the latter play contains enormous speeches , usually much longer than you will need , and is fearfully difficult material to cut . Berkoff makes particular demands on the actor . There are no character notes of any kind in the text , which is written as a complex rhyming scheme that looks like prose at first glance . He sets up long , colourful and emotional speeches that are in turn both funny , beautiful and violent , and his work can not be compared with anything that has preceded him . Finding a style in these parts without having seen a production of the play can be a problem , but as with absurd drama , there is a lot of room for personal interpretation . Few auditions seem to be chosen from the works of Samuel Beckett -- Waiting for Godot and Endgame are the only two which seem to offer possibilities . On the other hand , Harold Pinter 's characters Mick and Aston from The Caretaker are familiar , and both of them are still young and exciting enough to make good choices . Remember that anything which excites and interests you is a possibility and the greater the contrast with your first classical choice , the better you will enable the panel to see your present range . Coaching and presentation You will now perhaps be wondering whether or not you should be coached for your audition . Coaching can be a great help -- but it can also get in the way , for slavishly following a pedantic teacher can produce very strange results , with the candidate ending up trying to sound like someone he or she is n't . Your natural ability is the thing that should emerge , and if you have been well coached the coaching wo n't show . If you have been badly coached it will show everywhere . So it 's another of those difficult personal decisions . Choose your coach with care ; be sure that they know what they are doing for the theatre and actor of today . There are plenty of good coaches about just as there are a multitude of nice misguided types who seek to portray themselves through other people over and over again . You are the actor on show at your audition -- no-one is interested in auditioning your coach . Valuable coaching can often come from drama school tutors who can give a fair assessment of the possibilities you may have prior to auditioning . A list of such tutors is contained in Contacts ( address is given on p 17 ) . It can be well worth the additional expense of some private tuition for the audition and gaining one to one advice on your material . Your own presentation is another thing you need to be aware of . Clothes are important -- you should wear something which enhances your own self esteem and creates the right kind of impression . This is sometimes regarded as old fashioned thinking , unfortunately , and it 's a shame , for although clothes do n't actually make you perform better a good comfortable appearance does give the panel a chance to see how you see yourself and how your body uses clothes . When presenting a classical and a modern piece women may use a practice skirt for one selection which can be used over jeans , or another skirt . Men may wish to use a jacket for one piece and only a sweater for the other . And props ; what do you do about them at your audition ? Well , anything that can be carried and produced without a lot of fuss is permissable -- pipes , cigarettes , mirrors , handbags , fans , matches , etc . But the less elaborate you can be the better . Try to think of the essentials , as any good coach will tell you . For example , if you are embarking on Julia in Two Gentlemen of Verona and her Proteus letter , it is as well to have a sheet of paper that you can tear up to make the scene start with a dramatic focus and give the lines some action . Learning thoroughly the piece which you are going to do is important . Auditions are nerve-wracking for everyone who does them ( and for that matter , for everyone who watches them ) but being sure of your text is the least you can do . Should that unthinkable thing happen , and you forget your lines , do n't despair . A sympathetic panel may well ask you to start again . But there is no trick to the business of learning lines , as you will find out as you go on -- although learning lines for an audition is different from memorising a part in a play for production , because then you will be operating with other actors around you . On the whole , acting in isolation is a peculiar feature of the audition system , which is why the pieces you choose in either the classic or modern text need to be reasonably well contained and lend themselves to being performed as a one man show . If you have done any class work before attempting the drama school audition , most of the teachers will at some point in their sessions have talked about " relaxation " . A lot has to do with how you breathe and how you react physically to moments of tension . You will be tense at the audition because a lot is at stake , but if you trust to your own natural resources , the degree of panic can be reduced . I would suggest that if you are sure of your pieces , do n't read them over and over again on the way to the audition -- once will be quite enough . Nerves afflict everyone in some way , and without them acting would be the poorer . The dead calm actor is , on the whole , dead boring . Stage nerves are unlike anything else in the whole world , and many good actors will confess to them right through their careers . Stage fright is something else -- but it is usually self-induced and can be overcome , finally , with much rehearsal practice . When dealing with nerves , the most important single thing is to have a centre of concentration . Concentration has nothing to do with gritting your teeth and braving it out ; it 's the secret of being more and more relaxed and aware of everything that is going on at the same time . You will not only be sure of the text , but , more than this , of the character you are portraying . With well written characters the words fit and flow so that the actor can ride with ease , and the thoughts , no matter how disjointed , have a natural quality that is at once " actable " . No-one can hope to have a command of all these things at a first audition . But they are guidelines to what acting is basically about . Audition selections Here is a selection of speeches for both men and women that may be recommended for auditions at drama schools . It ca n't be stressed enough that you should know the entire play from which you select your audition piece ; not only that , but have thought carefully about the characters and their inter-relationship . The classical text Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare . Mercutio is in high spirits , teasing Romeo about his love as they prepare to go to the Capulet masked ball . He speaks to both Romeo and others around him , about dreams and dreamers . MERCUTIO O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you . She is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman Drawn with a team of little atomi Over men 's noses as they lie asleep . Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub , Time out o ' mind the fain-es ' coachmakers ; Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners ' legs , The cover of the wings of grasshoppers , Her traces of the smallest spider web , Her collars of the moonshine 's watery beams , Her whip of cricket 's bone , the lash of film , Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat , Not half so big as a round little worm Prick 'd from the lazy finger of a maid ; And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love ; O'er courtiers ' knees , that dream on curtsies straight ; O'er lawyers ' fingers who straight dream on fees ; O'er ladies ' lips , who straight on kisses dream , Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are . Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier 's nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit ; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig 's tail , Tickling a parson 's nose as a lies asleep ; Then dreams he of another benefice . Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , Of breaches , ambuscados , Spanish blades , Of healths five fathom deep ; and then anon Drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes , And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again . This is that very Mab Act 1 , Scene 4 Comment This is a very well known piece , which needs vivacity and spontaneity in presentation ; Mercutio is enjoying himself , weaving his way through a fantastical set of images . The problem lies in sustaining the speech , for Mercutio is a hearty and boisterous character , seemingly at odds with the mischief and delicacy of this speech . Would such a man talk of fairies like this ? Yet he obviously loves taunting Romeo about the " sickness " of love . King John by William Shakespeare Philip the Bastard , half brother to Robert Faulconbridge , and son of King Richard the First , discovers himself in a position of authority when King John knights him and dubs him Sir Richard Plantagenet . Left to his own reflections , he reveals himself to be a bright , keen opportunist . BASTARD Brother , adieu : good fortune come to thee ! For thou wast got i'the way of honesty . A foot of honour better than I was , But many a many foot of land the worse . Well , now can I make any Joan a lady . " Good den , Sir Richard ! " -- " God-a-mercy , fellow ! " -- And if his name be George , I 'll call him Peter ; " T is too respective and too sociable For your conversion . Now your traveller , He and his toothpick at my worship 's mess , And when my knightly stomach is suffic 'd , Why then I suck my teeth , and catechize My picked man of countries : " My dear sir , " -- Thus , leaning on mine elbow , I begin , I shall beseech you , " -- that is Question now ; And then comes Answer like an Absey book : " O sir , " says Answer , " at your best command ; At your employment ; at your service , sir : " " No , sir , " says Question , " I , sweet sir , at yours ; " And so , ere Answer knows what Question would , Saving in dialogue of compliment , And talking of the Alps and Apennines , It draws toward supper in conclusion so . But this is worshipful society , And fits the mounting spirit like myself ; For he is but a bastard to the time That doth not smack of observation ; And so am I , whether I smoke or no . And not alone in habit and device , Exterior form , outward accoutrement , But from the inward motion to deliver Sweet , sweet , sweet poison for the age 's tooth : Which , though I will not practise to deceive , Yet , to avoid deceit , I mean to learn ; For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising . But who comes in such haste in riding-robes ? What woman-post is this ! Hath she no husband That will take pains to blow a horn before her ? O me ! " t is my mother . How now , good lady ? What brings you here to court so hastily ? Exeunt all but the bastard Act 1 , Scene 1 Comment The character talks freely about himself , and what he hopes to gain from his new rank . The jokes and the conversations end abruptly with " But this is worshipful society " and at that point he shows his real toughness and ambition . The piece needs to be taken at a good pace and in high spirits . The Merchant of Veniceby William Shakespeare Lorenzo with his Jessica await the return of Portia , remaining out in the still night rather than returning to the house . LORENZO Sweet soullet 's in , and there expect their coming . And yet no matter : why should we go in ? My friend Stephano , signify ( I pray you ) Within the house , your mistress is at hand , And bring your music forth into the air . How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank ! Here will we sit , and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears -- soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony : Sit Jessica , -look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold , There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings , Still quiring to the young-ey 'd cherubins ; Such harmony is in immortal souls , But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in , we can not hear it : ... For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts Fetching mad bounds , bellowing and neighing loud , Which is the hot condition of their blood , -- If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound , Or any air of music touch their ears , You shall perceive them make a mutual stand , Their savage eyes turn 'd to a modest gaze , By the sweet power of music : therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees , stones and floods ; Since naught so stockish , hard and full of rage , But music for the time doth change his nature , -- The man that hath no music in himself , Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds , Is fit for treasons , stratagems , and spoils ; The motions of his spirit are dull as night , And his affections dark as Erebus : Let no such man be trusted : -- mark the music . Exit Stephano Act 5 , Scene 1 Comment This extract is made up of two consecutive speeches to Jessica ; either speech can be played for an audition , but if you have the time to do them both together the extract works well . Remember that this is an intimate scene with Jessica , and you should identify her clearly throughout . Allow the freshness of the thoughts to dominate , letting one idea lead into another . Love 's LaboursLost by William Shakespeare Berowne confesses to his love for Rosaline , with a good deal of witty , self mockery . BEROWNE O ! and I forsooth in love ! I , that have been love 's whip ; A very beadle to a humorous sigh ; A critic , nay , a night-watch constable , A domineering pedant o'er the boy , Than whom no mortal so magnificent ! This wimpled , whining , purblind , wayward boy , This senior-junior , giant-dwarf , dan Cupid ; Regent of love rhymes , lord of folded arms , The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans , Liege of all loiterers and malcontents , Dread prince of plackets , king of codpieces , Sole imperator and great general Of trotting paritors : O my little heart ! And I to be a corporal of his field , And wear his colours like a tumbler 's hoop ! What ! I love ! I sue ! I seek a wife ! A woman that is like a German clock , Still a-repairing , ever out of frame , And never going aright , being a watch , But being watch 'd that it may still go right ! Nay to be perjur 'd , which is worst of all ; And among three , to love the worst of all ; A whitely wanton with a velvet brow , With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes ; Ay and by heaven , one that will do the deed Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard : And I to sigh for her ! to watch for her ! To pray for her ! Go to ; it is a plague That Cupid will impose for my neglect Of his almighty dreadful little might . Well , I will love , write , sigh , pray , sue , and groan : Some men must love my lady , and some Joan . Act 3 , Scene 1 Comment Berowne almost seems to revel in his own discomfiture here , in his desperate last stand for freedom -he clearly enjoys the sensation of falling in love , even though he presents the experience as a disaster ! Invite the audience to listen to your dilemma , and keep the pace quick , for there is nothing solemn about Berowne . Titus Andronicusby William Shakespeare Aaron is a Moorish soldier of fortune , who with his mistress , Tamora , has been captured by the Romans in their war against the Goths . AARON Now climbeth Tamora Olympus ' top , Safe out of fortune 's shot , and sits aloft , Secure of thunder 's crack or lightning flash , Advanc 'd above pale envy 's threat'ning reach . As when the golden sun salutes the morn , And , having gilt the ocean with his beams , Gallops the Zodiac in his glistering coach , And overlooks the highest-peering hills ; So Tamora . Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait , And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown . Then , Aaron , arm thy heart , and fit thy thoughts , To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress , And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held , fett'red in amorous chains , And faster bound to Aaron 's charming eyes Than is Prometheus bound to Caucasus . Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts ! I will be bright , and shine in pearl and gold , To wait upon this new-made empress . To wait , said I ? to wanton with this queen , This goddess , this Semiramis , this nymph , This siren that will charm Rome 's Saturnine , And see his shipwrack and his commonweal 's . Holla ! what storm is this ? Comment This is one of the great roles for a black actor ( not that black actors in these days are not eligible to play practically any character in Shakespeare , with the exception of Desdemona ! ) . Aaron , lover of Tamora , has been brought to Rome a captive , then freed . He is relishing his future . He is a witty , ruthless adventurer : a strange and exotic outsider in Rome , and a villain on the grand scale . To scan , Semiramis should be pronounced SeMIRamis not SEMiramis . Love 's Labours Lostby William Shakespeare Rosaline chides Berowne , and taxes him with certain conditions he must fulfil if he is to gain her hand ( the Princess and her ladies have responded to the death of the King of France by postponing any further romance for one year ) . ROSALINE Oft have I heard of you , my Lord Berowne , Before I saw you , and the world 's large tongue Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks ; full of comparisons and wounding flouts , Which you on all estates will execute That lie within the mercy of your wit : To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain , And there withal to win me , if you please , Without the which I am not to be won , You shall this twelve month term from day to day , Visit the speechless sick , and still converse With groaning wretches ; and your task shall be , With all the fierce endeavour of your wit To enforce the pained impotent to smile . BEROWNE To move wild laughter LORENZO in the throat of death ? It can not be ; it is impossible : Mirth can not move a soul in agony . ROSALINE Why , that 's the way to choke a gibing spirit , Whose influence is begot of that loose grace Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools . A jest 's prosperity lies in the ear Of him that hears it , never in the tongue Of him that makes it : then , if sickly ears , Deaf 'd with the clamours of their own dear groans , Will hear your idle scorns , continue then , And I will have you and that fault withal ; But if they will not , throw away that spirit , And I shall find you empty of that fault , Right joyful of your reformation . Act 5 , Scene 2 Comment It 's important to pick the right vocal note for Rosaline , as her wit and sexuality need to be put across here . Rosaline is very much a match for Berowne ; this is her last challenge to him , at a moment in the play when death has blown all comedy away . Her challenge is , in itself , almost cruelly witty , and Rosaline must be seen to relish the situation , rather than becoming priggish . Essentially , what she wants is for Berowne to discover what is serious in life , and to stop fooling all the time . Measure for Measureby William Shakespeare Isabella has visited Angelo to plead for her brother 's life . Angelo offers her a bargain : if she will sleep with him her brother shall live . This speech is her shocked reaction to Angelo 's " proposal " . ISABELLA To whom should I complain ? Did I tell this , Who would believe me ? O perilous mouths , That bear in them one and the self-same tongue Either of condemnation or approof , Bidding the law make curtsey to their will , Hooking both right and wrong to th ' appetite , To follow as it draws ! I 'll to my brother . Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood , Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour , That had he twenty heads to tender down On twenty bloody blocks , he 'd yield them up Before his sister should her body stoop To such abhorr 'd pollution . Then , Isabel live chaste , and brother , die : More than our brother is our chastity . I 'll tell him yet of Angelo 's request , And fit his mind to death , for his soul 's rest . Act 2 , Scene 4 Comment Isabella can very easily come across as a prig . Her virtue is so important to her that she can more easily contemplate her brother sacrificing his life to save her virginity than that she might sacrifice herself for him . Isabella perceives clearly the game Angelo is playing : here she is angry and frustrated -- do n't try and make her too " nice " a character . Two Gentlemen of Verona by William Shakespeare Julia with a letter in her hand , speaks first to Lucetta . Some lines previous to the main speech have been incorporated here . JULIA This babble shall not henceforth trouble me . Here is a coil with protestation . Go , get you gone ; and let the papers lie . You would be fing'ring them , to anger me . Nay , would I were so anger 'd with the same ! O hateful hands , to tear such loving words ; Injurious wasps , to feed on such sweet honey , And kill the bees that yield it , with your stings ! I 'll kiss each several paper , for amends . Look , here is writ " kind Julia " : -- unkind Julia ! As in revenge of thy ingratitude , I throw thy name against the bruising stones , Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain . And here is writ " love-wounded Proteus " . Poor wounded name : my bosom , as a bed , Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal 'd ; And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss . But twice , or thrice , was " Proteus " written down : Be calm , good wind , blow not a word away , Till I have found each letter , in the letter , Except mine own name : that some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged , fearful , hanging rock , And throw it thence into the raging sea . Lo , here in one line is his name twice writ : " Poor forlorn Proteus " , " passionate Proteus " . " To the sweet Julia " : that I 'll tear away . And yet I will not , sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names . Thus will I fold them , one upon another : Now kiss , embrace , contend , do what you will . She tears the letter . Lucetta leaves Act 1 , Scene 2 Comment The essential qualities of this character are her impulsiveness and her youthful alertness . How far does she commit herself to Proteus , and does she really criticise herself ? Think out your actions so that they enhance the text . As You Like It by William Shakespeare Rosalind , disguised as a young man ( Ganymede ) speaks to Phoebe , who clearly considers her to be an attractive male . Rosalind comments shrewdly upon her own sex in her admonishment of Phoebe . ROSALIND And why I pray you ? Who might be your mother , That you insult , exult , and all at once , Over the wretched ? What though you have no beauty -- As by my faith I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed -- Must you be therefore proud and pitiless ? Why what means this ? Why do you look on me ? I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of Nature 's sale-work . " Od 's my little life , I think she means to tangle my eyes too ! No faith proud mistress , hope not after it . " T is not your inky brows , your black silk hair , Your bugle eyeballs , nor your cheek of cream , That can entame my spirits to your worship . You foolish shepherd , wherefore do you follow her Like foggy South puffing with wind and rain ? You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman . " T is such fools as you That makes the world full of ill-favour 'd children . 'T IS not her glass but you that flatters her , And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her . But mistress , know yourself , down on your knees , And thank heaven , fasting , for a good man 's love ; For I must tell you friendly in your ear , Sell when you can , you are not for all markets . Cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer ; Foul is most foul , being foul to be scoffer . So take her to thee shepherd . Fare you well . Act 3 , Scene 5 Comment A very well known audition piece , but nonetheless valid for all that . Do n't , on any account , go for a heavy-handed male impersonation here -- Rosalind is an intelligent woman , with a sense of humour , and she is enjoying herself responding to Phoebe 's rather obvious games . A Midsummer Night 's Dream by William Shakespeare TITANIA These are the forgeries of jealousy : And never , since the middle summer 's spring , Met we on hill , in dale , forest or mead , By paved fountain , or by rushy brook , Or in the beached margent of the sea , To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , But with thy brawls thou hast disturb 'd our sport . Therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , As in revenge have suck 'd up from the sea Contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents . The ox hath therefore stretch 'd his yoke in vain . The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain 'd a beard ; The fold stands empty in the drowned field , And crows are fatted with the murrion flock ; The nine-men's-morris is fill 'd up with mud , And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable . The human mortals want their winter cheer : No night is now with hymn or carol blest . Therefore the moon , the governess of floods , Pale in her anger , washes all the air , That rheumatic diseases do abound . And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; And on old Hiems ' thin and icy crown , An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is , as in mockery , set ; the spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter , change Their wonted liveries ; and the mazed world , By their increase , now knows not which is which . And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate , from our dissension ; We are their parents and original . Act 2 , Scene 1 Comment The piece includes a great deal of descriptive colour ; only try it if you feel you can bring something of your own imagination to it , and be prepared to risk some indulgence . Keep Titania tough , springy and challenging : this speech is an accusation , and the expression of her grievance against Oberon . The Beaux ' Stratagem by George Farquhar Mrs Sullen is a young gentlewoman , living in the country much against her will , and chafing against marriage to a drunken brute . MRS SULLEN Country Pleasures ! Racks and Torments ! dost think , Child , that my Limbs were made for leaping of Ditches , and clambring over Stiles ; or that my Parents wisely foreseeing my future Happiness in Country-pleasures , had early instructed me in the rural Accomplishments of drinking fat Ale , playing at Whisk , and smoaking Tobacco with my Husband ; or of spreading of Plaisters , brewing of Diet-drinks , and stilling Rosemary-Water with the good old Gentlewoman , my Mother-in-Law ... . Not that I disapprove rural Pleasures , as the Poets have painted them ; in their Landschape every Phillis has her Coridon , every murmuring Stream , and every flowry Mead gives fresh Alarms to Love . -- Besides , you 'll find , that their Couples were never marry 'd : -- But yonder I see my Coridon , and a sweet Swain it is Heaven knows ; -- Come , Dorinda , do n't be angry , he 's my Husband , and your Brother ; and between us both is he not a sad Brute ? O Sister , Sister ! if ever you marry , beware of a sullen , silent Sot , one that 's always musing , but never thinks : -- There 's some Diversion in a talking Blockhead : and since a Woman must wear Chains , I wou 'd have the Pleasure of hearing 'em rattle a little . -- Now you shall see , but take this by the way -- He came home this Morning at his usual Hour of Four , waken 'd me out of a sweet Dream of something else , by tumbling over the Tea-table , which he broke all to pieces , after his Man and he had rowl 'd about the Room like sick Passengers in a Storm , he comes flounce into Bed , dead as a Salmon into a Fishmonger 's Basket ; his Feet cold as Ice , his Breath hot as a Furnace , and his hands and Face as greasy as his Flanel Night-cap . -- O Matrimony ! He tosses up the Clothes with a barbarous swing over his Shoulders , disorders the whole Economy of my Bed , leaves me half naked , and my whole Night 's Comfort is the tuneable Serenade of that wakeful Nightingale , his Nose . -- O the Pleasure of counting melancholly Clock by a snoring Husband ! -- But now , Sister , you shall see how handsomely , being a well-bred Man , he will beg my Pardon . Comment Mrs Sullen is anything but sullen . She describes the horrors of matrimony with vivacious comic indignation , dazzling wit and choice of expression , and with breathtaking eloquence . She is young and pretty , and filters her fury through irresistible humour . She is not bitter , cynical , languid , or camp . I 've left the original spelling and orthography to give a feel of the vigour of the language . It must be one of the funniest speeches ever written for an actress , and needs a bubbly , light touch . Not for the novice , but still worth attempting . The Relapse or Virtue in Danger by John Vanbrugh Lord Foppington arrives at the London house of Loveless and Amanda . Foppington recently " bought " his peerage ; he was formerly known as " Sir Novelty Fashion " , and he speaks with gusto and effrontery , his speech deliberately affected , turning his " o " s to " a " s . FOPPINGTON Far to mind the inside of a book , is to entertain one 's self with the products of another man 's brain . Naw I think a man of quality and breeding may be much better diverted with the natural sprauts of his own . But to say the truth , madam , let a man love reading never so well , when once he comes to know this tawn , he finds so many better ways of passing the four-and-twenty hours , that 't were ten thousand pities he should consume his time in that . Far example , madam , my life ; my life , madam is a perpetual stream of pleasure , that glides through such a variety of entertainments , I believe the wisest of our ancestors never had the least conception of any of 'em . I rise , madam , about ten a-clock . I do n't rise sooner , because 't is the worst thing in the world for the complexion ; nat that I pretend to be a beau ; but a man must endeavour to look wholesome , lest he make so nauseous a figure in the side-bax , the ladies should be compelled to turn their eyes upon the play . So at ten a-clack , I say , I rise . Naw , if I find 't is a good day , I resalve to take a turn in the Park , and see the fine women ; so huddle on my clothes , and get dressed by one . If it be nasty weather , I take a turn in the chocolate-hause : where , as you walk , madam , you have the prettiest prospect in the world ; you have lookingglasses all round you . -- But I 'm afraid I tire the company . Act 2 , Scene 1 Comment A rich restoration character , not recommended unless there is some reasonable experience working in the style . Foppington is the King of Fops ; hard and witty , not soft and camp ; relish the tartness of his delivery , his enjoyment of the spoken word . The modern text Not Quite Jerusalem by Paul Kember Mike , a Cambridge undergraduate who is working on a kibbutz is talking to the Jewish girl Gila and explaining why he left university to end up in Israel . He finds it difficult to describe his feelings and says at first " I just walked out . " Gila presses him to explain his reasons to her . MIKE I do n't know , I was just sitting on the grass one day , down by the river . Everyone else was lying around and I just thought : " That 's it , I 've had enough " . And I just walked away leaving everything -- clothes , money , records , books ... Pause And I walked . I just kept walking . Walking and walking in the pissing rain . I just walked . Nothing momentous . No dead birds fell from the trees . No portents . I just walked , all the way along Trumpington Road . I got as far as Grantchester and I thought , fuck it , yes , why not ? Do it . Pause The heart of England trip . Get in touch with the true essence of England , what it is to be English . Let the village atmosphere seep into your pores . See if you can make contact with it , this magical thing called Englishness . I wanted to see if I could experience it . The place was deserted . I kept walking , past the old mill , right up around the bend to where the council property starts , and I thought , oh , shit , council houses . I 'm never going to find the spirit of true Englishness there . So I headed back to the village . Looked at all the usual things ; the cottages , the rectory and so on and , eventually ended up in the churchyard ; the one where Rupert Brooke is buried . And there 's the poem presumed to be about the clock stopping . And it 's all so wonderful and idyllic . And I was scouting around vaguely aware that , in fact , I 'd actually located it . The English ideal . That this essence of Englishness was actually there in my possession ... And suddenly I caught sight of this ... prat sailing down the Cam back towards Cambridge in a punt , with a girl doing all the work , while he reclined at the exact angle , trying to play a chord and strum a tune ... There was this idiot , sailing along desperately trying to simulate an atmosphere of ... Christ knows " Some vague recollection of tranquillity from his grandfather 's scrapbook . " It was all there . The spires in the background , the river , this typical English village -- and this prat -- this arch tit -- sailing through the stillness of centuries -- absolutely fucking clueless . I walked out of the village , got to the main road , turned right instead of left and here I am . How do you put that in a letter ? Are you any wiser ? Pause Pause Comment No particular accent is asked for , but Mike is not the conventional public school type who has gone to Cambridge . He speaks with really quite a small vocabulary which suggests he is unused to expressing himself eloquently . Part of the time he may almost be unaware that he is speaking to another person -- after all Gila does n't understand English very well and it is unlikely that she would fully understand the references to Rupert Brooke and the poem " The Old Vicarage , Grantchester " . ( Suggest that you read that poem as a background . ) Not Quite Jerusalem by Paul Kember Carrie is in her mid to late twenties and comes from Birmingham . She talks incessantly and seems over-enthusiastic about nearly every aspect of life -- prattling on without caring much about the kind of responses she gets from other human beings around . In this speech ( comprising in fact two consecutive speeches ) she talks to Mike about herself and impressions of the kibbutz life . CARRIE Oh , yes . I must say , I had certain ambitions for higher education myself , but when you receive the call , as they say , those cherished dreams just have to go by the board . Not that I would have attempted to scale the academic heights of an Oxford or a Cambridge , of course , but they do do some very stimulating courses at the Birmingham Polytechnic . Mind you I 've taken the precaution of leaving all my nursing manuals at home . If you 're going to take a break it may as well be a clean one . Incidentally , have you been to the kibbutz library yet ? Tuesdays seven to nine p. m . They 've got some very interesting works . Unfortunately most of them are in Hebrew . But there 's quite a stack of paperbacks left behind by other volunteers . It 's pretty lightweight , most of it and what is n't lightweight is salacious , so I would n't think you 'd find much to stimulate you there , but you could try . I was in there last night trying to get some ideas for Volunteers Day . Not that I managed . You know , of course , we had our second meeting last night ? Needless to say , nobody turned up . I sat for half an hour outside the dining room like a pickle in a jam factory . Oh , do n't worry , I 'm not getting at you . You were probably busy working , I appreciate that . It 's the others I 'm worried about . Comments This is a straight comedy speech ( though the character does not find herself funny ) . She is a busybody who likes talking and has cultivated her own style . Her Birmingham background is hinted at and if you can manage a Birmingham accent it might be useful , but it is not essential in finding the character . Teeth'n Smiles by David Hare Arthur is a twenty-six year old song writer in the world of rock music , c . 1975 , ( the date the play was first performed at the Royal Court Theatre ) . ARTHUR Where I first met Maggie . She was singing in the Red Lion . She was sixteen , seventeen , a folk singer . Let us go a pickin ' nuts , fol de ray , to Glastonbury Fair , a tiddle dum ay . I had to carry her over the wall , can you imagine , to get her to my rooms . They build walls here to stop undergraduates making love . Well , we got caught , of course , by this very Mr Snead coming in satirical German manner , even shining a torch , an English suburban stormf�hrer . He hauled me up to my tutor , who said , do you intend to marry the girl ? I said , not entirely . He said , as this is a first offence you will not be sent down , instead , I fine you ten pounds for having a girl on the premises . I said what you mean like a brothel charge ? I was furious , I was out of my mind . He takes another cigarette Thanks . And everyone told me : do n't waste your energy . Because that 's what they want . They invent a few rules that do n't mean anything so that you can ruin your health trying to change them . Then overnight they redraft them because they did n't really matter in the first place . One day it 's a revolution to say fuck on bus . Next day it 's the only way to get a ticket . That 's how the system works . An obstacle course . Unimportant . Well , perhaps . Comment This is reflective speech ; the character seems rootless and so there is no definite accent or background indicated . We gather that he comes from the university where they are now playing the concert . After taking the cigarette ( an important prop in this speech ) Arthur changes tack . He seems to be talking in a series of jumpy thoughts . For this reason the speed of the speech may be slower than it looks , the cigarette smoking being used to punctuate it . Teeth'n Smiles by David Hare Maggie , in between numbers at a rock concert , talks to Laura about the young student who has just made love to her . MAGGIE He was in a bit of a state , I could n't believe it . I think he must have juiced himself up . He said your thighs are so beautiful , your thighs are so beautiful , well , Laura , you seen my thighs . I said please let 's not ... I 'd rather you just ... He said your body is like a book in which men may read strange things , a foreign country in which they may travel with delight . Your cheeks like damask , the soft white loveliness of your breasts , leading to the firm dark mountain peaks of your , Laura , now I 'm dreading which part of my body he will choose next on which to turn the great white beam of his fucking sincerity . Between your legs the silver comets spiral through the night , I lose myself , he says ... he says ... how beautiful you are Maggie and how beautiful life ought to be with you . Pause . She cries Then eventually ... I say please , faking . He says yes of course , he stops talking . We wait . For thirty minutes . For thirty minutes it is like trying to push a marshmallow into a coinbox . Pause Then he manages . In his way . Afterwards he says it 's his fault . I say no mine , perhaps the choice of location ... he says it ca n't be your fault , you have made love to the most brilliant and beautiful men of your generation , you have slept with the great . I say there are no great , there is no beautiful , there is only the thin filth of getting old , the thin layer of filth that gets to cover everything . So . Off he goes . Ta ta . Comment Maggie is a young , burnt-out pop singer . The piece requires delicacy , to express the real awfulness she senses in her life . The phrasing needs particular care . The Real Thing by Tom Stoppard Debbie , the teenage daughter of the writer Henry , talks with her father about his work and about her own life . In this extract three speeches have been linked together . DEBBIE What , House of Cards ? Well , it was n't about anything , except did she have it off or did n't she ? What a crisis . Infidelity among the architect class . Again . Most people think not having it off is fidelity . They think all relationships hinge in the middle . Sex or no sex . What a fantastic range of possibilities . Like an on/ off switch . Did she or did n't she . By Henry Ibsen . Why would you want to make it such a crisis ? It 's what comes of making such a mystery of it . When I was twelve I was obsessed . Everything was sex . Latin was sex . The dictionary fell open at meretrix , a harlot . You could feel the mystery coming off the word like musk . Meretrix ! This was none of your mensa-a-table , this was a flash from the forbidden planet , and it was everywhere . History was sex , French was sex , art was sex , the Bible , poetry , penfriends , games , music , everything was sex except biology which was obviously sex but obviously not really sex , not the one which was secret and ecstatic and wicked and a sacrament and all the things it was supposed to be at one and the same time -- I got that in the boiler room and it turned out to be biology after all . That 's what free love is free of -- propaganda . Act 2 , Scene 7 Comment A seventeen year old , bright and intelligent enough to put herself on an equal footing with her father . She does have affection for him but is not over-impressed with his success as a writer and she speaks directly from her own experience rather than any vicarious sensations . Be careful not to create anyone with a phoney Chelsea " Sloane " accent or anything outrageous . She speaks good standard English without any affectation . The Real Thing by Tom Stoppard Henry , a successful playwright , is being pushed by his wife to re-write or adapt a play by a raw young man called Brodie , who is in prison . Henry has no wish to do this and chooses to explain to Annie why he finds Brodie 's work clumsy and ill-constructed . HENRY He holds up a cricket bat . Shut up and listen . This thing here , which looks like a wooden club , is actually several pieces of particular wood cunningly put together in a certain way so that the whole thing is sprung , like a dance floor . It 's for hitting cricket balls with . If you get it right , the cricket ball will travel two hundred yards in four seconds , and all you 've done is give it a knock like knocking the top off a bottle of stout , and it makes a noise like a trout taking a fly ... What we 're trying to do is to write cricket bats , so that when we throw up an idea and give it a little knock , it might ... travel ... Now , what we 've got here is a lump of wood roughly the same shape trying to be a cricket bat , and if you hit a ball with it , the ball will travel about ten feet and you will drop the bat and dance about shouting " Ouch ! " with your hands stuck into your armpits . This is n't better because someone says it 's better , or because there 's a conspiracy by the MCC to keep cudgels out of Lords . It 's better because it 's better . He clucks his tongue to make the noise . He clucks his tongue again and picks up the script . Indicating the cricket bat . You do n't believe me , so I suggest you go out to bat with this and see how you get on . " You 're a strange boy , Billy , how old are you ? " " Twenty , but I 've lived more than you 'll ever live . " Ooh , ouch ! He drops the script and hops about with hands in his armpits , going " Ouch ! " Act 2 , Scene 2 Comment A mature man , Henry speaks with style and wit about the art of playwriting to his wife ( who is prepared to listen ! ) . The speech is rich in comic sensitivity . Taking a cricket bat to the audition is n't a bad idea although you can get the same effect with an umbrella . In fact the props of the speech are important and not too difficult to use to help your presentation . Night and Day by Tom Stoppard The play is set in a imaginary African Republic , Kambawe . In this scene the country 's president , Mageeba , talks with an Australian journalist . The president is finely educated and is capable of talking like a professor and behaving like a despot . This piece includes several speeches edited together . MAGEEBA At the time of independence the Daily Citizen was undoubtedly free . It was free to select the news it thought fit to print , to make much of it , or little , and free to make room for more girls wearing less and less underwear . You may smile , but does freedom of the press mean freedom to choose its own standards ? ... down , as I would have been obliged to do had it not been burned down during the state of emergency which followed independence . But what to put in its place ? The English millionaire folded his singed tents and stole away the insurance money , which did n't belong to him since I had nationalized the paper well before the fire was out . Material missing from transcription at this point ; can not correct or quantify , as original not available and book out of print Never mind -- the field was open . I did not believe a newspaper should be part of the apparatus of the state ; we are not a totalitarian society . But neither could I afford a return to the whims of private enterprise . I had the immense and delicate task of restoring confidence in Kambawe . I could afford the naked women but not the naked scepticism , the carping and sniping and the public washing of dirty linen which represents freedom to an English editor . What then ? A democratic committee of journalists ? -- a thorn bush for the editor to hide in . No , no -- freedom with responsibility , that was the elusive formula we pondered all those years ago at the LSE . And that is what I found . From the ashes there arose , by public subscription , a new Daily Citizen , responsible and relatively free . He leans towards Wagner Do you know what I mean by a relatively free press , Mr Wagner ? ... I mean a free press which is edited by one of my relatives . He throws back his head and laughs . Act 2 Comment For a black actor this speech gives a major opportunity to convey power and style . Mageeba makes no concessions to the white political world yet he understands a great deal about it . Ask yourself about the current African political scene and read round it to find interesting parallels , since Mageeba represents a mixture of the kind of African leadership to be found . A Lily in Little India by Donald Howarth . Alvin Hanker is in his room . He has just broken one of his records deliberately and is on his knees picking up the pieces as he talks to himself . ALVIN You 're silenced forever if your groove 's not joined . I 'm sorry I broke you in sacrifice . Never mind . I 'll get you another one again . " If only you 'd read for once or play cards . Find yourself a hobby like other people , go to the pictures , the night school , the dancing , the football , the ... " Night school . He rises and puts the pieces into the drawer of the chest of drawers He mimics his mother 's voice If I went to night school I 'd be a student . Alvin student . There are too many . Students all trying . Besides , there 's only one for the top of the class . I might look well with a hobby . If you have a private sideline , that 's it . No-one expects you to present the result . You can do it when you come home from work and you 're all right at week-ends . i could dance . I could be taught . " Bert Shutt 's Palais 's no good for dancing with Alvin Hanker . " A dance floor 's for partners . Four legs behave as two on the ballroom boards . Never mind dancing . Too many dance . Too many legs on ballroom floors , crowding each other out on to the pavements . Dancing 's overcrowded like the pavements . All going to the pictures . I like the pictures . Sitting in the pictures -- getting dark and warm and watching with the music all the time playing from nowhere . Film stars are real and all first class with big faces -- and they 're good at it . I get on well at the films . It would be sitting at the pictures if I could have the money to do it fill time . I could borrow . But there 's the travelling to get to the one the night after and seeing a different one every middle of the week . I could n't afford the fares into town as well as a reasonable seat for sitting in . Playing at cards is n't for one , except Patience . But I cheat so that 's out . I could read . It 's quiet . I could read a lot . Seven books a week . He sits in the chair He mimics a young woman 's voice He rises and takes on imaginary partner He dances He steps on his partner 's toes He sits Library books . Long books -- full of quiet reading far from Mrs Raistrick 's ears , Books with photographs beside the print , beautiful , like film stars , but quiet . Slender , thin-backed books with titles , books on buildings , books on ships , on bridges , books on end , books on wardrobes never dusted , books on gardening books . Flower books on flowers . Act 1 Comment This character has a northern accent and the fact is important to the handling of the piece . He is on his own and definitely talking aloud to himself in the privacy of his room . There is no need to over-play the slightly pathetic quality but seek out the eagerness of his search for something to do . His imitations of other voices calls for a good sense of mimicry , and should bring the dreariness of his life into focus . Perhaps you could have two pieces of broken gramophone record with you as a prop to start the extract . Not about Heroes by Stephen Macdonald This is a play for two characters , Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen , the World War One poets , and it would obviously be a good thing to read some of their poetry as a background to performing this piece . Sassoon survived the war and died in 1967 . Owen , seven years younger , was killed one week before the war ended . The play is an imaginative reconstruction of their friendship . SASSOON By the 8th June , I was back in the front line . Our mission was to take back from the Boche those few miles of battered ground that we 'd bought with half a million lives in those Battles of the Somme , two years before . i found myself in the same place where I 'd been wounded in Easter , 1917 . Hundreds of thousands of lives had bought nothing , had proved nothing . i wonder ... what was I trying to prove ? just that I was not a sheep , waiting to be slaughtered , at their command . And nor would i lead my company to be slaughtered , at their command . Another Protest , I suppose . Even more ineffectual than the first . All I did was to out on a raid -- unofficially . And when the sun came up in no-man's-land , it was hot . A beautiful summer morning . I took off my tin hat to feel the sun on my face . And I did n't hear the bullet leaving the rifle . One moment I was revelling in the astonishment of being alive , and the next -- I was lying flat on my face , with what felt like a very large hole in the right side of my skull ... They carried me back to England in the middle of July . My war seemed to be over . I could n't understand why I 'd not been killed when there were so many others who ... It took me a long time to accept the fact that now I should not be killed -- that I should be one of the survivors . After all that I was going to live on ... alone ... to write the " Memoirs " ... to listen to Mozart in Salzburg . OWEN ... In a village near Amiens , I found a shop where you can still get tea , and enough cakes to make a schoolboy sick for a week . I 'll remember when ( go up the line ... That will be any hour now . I feel confident because I know I came out to help : directly , by leading them as well as an officer can ; indirectly , by watching their sufferings so that I may plead for them as well as I can . I have done the first ... Very dear Siegfried . I have been in action some days . Our experience passed the limits of abhorrence : I lost all my earthly faculties and fought like an angel . You 'll guess what happened when I say that I am now commanding the Company -- and in the line I had a seraphic boy-lance-corporal as my sergeant-major . I have mentioned my excellent batman , Jones . In the first wave of the attack he was shot in the head and thrown on top of me . He lay there dead , his blood soaking my shoulder for half an hour . It 's still there , crimson , on my tunic . i ca n't say I suffered anything -- having let my brain grow dull . My nerves , then , are in perfect order . My senses are charred . I shall feel again as soon as I dare , but now I must not . I do n't take the cigarette out of my mouth when I write " Deceased " across their letters ... Siegfried , I do n't know what you 'll think , but I 've been recommended for the MC -- and I 've recommended every single NCO who was with me . I 'm glad of it -- for the confidence it will give me at home . I think it 's all over for a long time . Moreover , the war is nearing an end . Do you know what you will do ? What are you doing now ? Can you tell me ? ( In this extract several pieces of Owen 's dialogue have been put together . ) Comment Sassoon Sassoon was a public school man ( read his book Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man ) and his slightly cold style is only a front for his real feelings . It is probably best to take this piece seated , to suggest a character looking back reflectively at the events recalled . Owen Owen was from Shropshire , from a less smart background than Sassoon . Do n't try to play the speech poetically . There are many shifting thoughts to be considered in this extract , and there is colour too ; you need to convey the spurts of energy vocally . The Apple Cart by George Bernard Shaw The play is a fable , of an England ruled over by King Magnus . Orinthia is his mistress and this speech is taken from an amusing scene between Orinthia and Magnus . Orinthia replies to Magnus 's words , " It must be magnificent to have the consciousness of a goddess without ever doing anything to justify it . " ORINTHIA Give me a goddess 's work to do ; and I will do it . I will even stoop to a queen 's work if you will share the throne with me . But do not pretend that people become great by doing great things . They do great things because they are great , if the great things come along . But they are great just the same when the great things do not come along . If I never did anything but sit in this room and powder my face and tell you what a clever fool you are , i should still be heavens high above the millions of common women who do their domestic duty , and sacrifice themselves , and run Trade departments and all the rest of the vulgarities . Has all the tedious public work you have done made you any the better ? I have seen before and after your boasted strokes of policy ; and you were the same man , and would have been the same man to me and to yourself if you had never done them . Thank God my self-consciousness is something nobler than vulgar conceit in having done something . It is what I am , not what I do , that you must worship in me . Comment There is more to this speech , but this seems a good place to stop for a short and effective audition . Orinthia is an expansive , richly styled character , based on the exotic personality of actress Mrs Patrick Campbell . The voice needs to be rich and varied , flirtatious and worldly wise . A Mad World , My Masters by Barry Keefe This is a modern version of the Elizabethan " City " comedy , a panorama of town life , teeming with villains , mugs , lechers and madmen . The atmosphere is rich and steamy , Superintendant Sayers tries with little success to keep order . SUPT . SAYERS Hello Hello ... hardly what you 'd call grief with a large G. I smell a con . I smell it as surely as I smell a knocked off car , a crooked log book . One previous owner ? Who 's that -- Julius Caesar ? My wit numbs them to speechlessness . Then I pounce with devastating questions to expose their guilt . Like Magnus Magnusson I am . An intrepid interrogator . Twenty five years in the service , 43 murder cases . All that , and I still ca n't get a mortgage . No home , no mortgage , that 's me . I 've seen the places I want . Lovely little mock Tudor semis in the wog-free suburbs . But these mortgage companies , they do n't want to know ... Nor the councils . They say no , 'cause I 've got a police house . Look , mate , I 've got nothing against these Indians , Chinese , Pakistanis , Blacks you name 'em I 've got nothing against them -- apart from them being here . But what I want to know is this -- how come a Pakistani hot off the banana boat can get a mortgage when a decent cop with 25 years service in the force can not ? Look mate , what this country needs is someone to look up to . Someone to stop all this weak kneed nancy pancying pussy footing soft balls hard luck Jim have another large scotch . I went to Northampton to try and get a mortgage . I heard they was dishing out council mortgages left right and centre up there . If you so much as parked on a yellow line they stuffed a mortgage application under your windscreen wipers . What did they say to me ? Oh yes , you guessed it . I 'll follow the Sprightlys . Observe them . From a safe distance . Comment Sayers is a comically baleful disappointed copper . The ultimate Ogre-Cop : racist , sexist , fascist and reactionary . From his bowler to his riding-mac to his moustache to his highly-polished shoes he embodies spleen and dodginess . He speaks like a quietly sinister sergeant-major . Sugar and Spice by Nigel Williams Carol is one of a party of young punk girls . She and her friend Sharon have been pursued by some boys , who are taunting Carol to take her clothes off . Sharon tells Carol she is making a spectacle of herself -- and Carol turns on her friend in the following speech . CAROL Ah , leave off me Sharon . I wanner be me if you wanner know an ' woss so wrong wiv vat . An ' if you mus ' know I like wearin ' nice clothes an ' I like the way boys look at me when I go down the schtreet an ' I like to look sexy an ' I like lipstick an ' showin ' meself off an ' all that I enjoy it . O. K. ? Thass wot I call livin ' if you mus ' know . An ' I du n no 'ow long I 'll be livin ' 'fore I 'm sick like yore ol ' lady 'angin ' rahnd ver launjrette an ' waitin ' up fer ol ' man an ' 'avin ' Gawd knows 'ow many kids 'angin ' rahnd me an ' " Mummy this " and " Mummy that " my Gawd if you mus ' know Sharon all my life all I fuckin ' wanner do is shine up there like a dancer or sunnink . Like sunnink reely glamorous that everyone wants an ' I ca n't see woss so wrong wiv vat . 'Cos I ai n't gonner get no kitchen wiv pitcher winders an ' some geezer wiv a pipe like you was on abaht am I now ? I be lucky I get any bloke fer more'n two monfs togewer like my ol ' lady I suppose an ' if I get a bloke 'e 'll be aht a ' work or 'e 'll set me ter the bleed'n game like 'er I would n't be surprised but if you reely want ter now jus ' fer now for this minute I wanner enjoy it . I wanner go up in a pile a smoke an ' flames an ' eye shadder an ' levver shoes an ' dancin ' an ' all that I 'll go like them girls in the magazines Sharon an ' you ai n't goin ' ter stop me . O. K. ? Act 2 Comment This speech in the cockney vernacular reads almost like a foreign language , but it has a well defined construction and rhythm . Notice how some of the words when repeated are better spoken than at other times , according to the level of passion in the delivery . The absence of punctuation is also a part of the style -but in spite of this you can sense the character struggling to articulate her thoughts clearly . Educating Rita by Willy Russell Rita is a young , married , working-class hairdresser , who rebels against her circumstances , and decides to acquire a higher education . She 's talking to Frank , her university tutor . RITA What ? Do you mean like that working-class culture thing ? I do n't see any , y'know , culture . I just see everyone pissed , or on the Valium , tryin ' to get from one day to the next . Y ' dare n't say that round our way like , cos they 're proud . They 'll tell y ' they 've got culture as they sit there drinkin ' keg beer out of plastic glasses . They 're not content with it , cos there 's no meaning . They tell y ' stories about the past , y ' know , the war , or when they were fightin ' for food an ' clothin ' an houses . Their eyes light up as they tell y ' , because there was some meanin ' to it . But the thing is that now , I mean now that most of them have got some sort of house , an ' there 's food an ' money around , they know they 're better off but , honest , they know they 've got nothin ' as well . There 's like this sort of disease , but no one mentions it ; everyone behaves as though it 's normal , y ' know inevitable that there 's vandalism an , violence an , houses burnt out an ' wrecked by the people they were built for . There 's somethin ' wrong . An ' like the worst thing is that y ' know the people who are like supposed to represent the people on our estate , y ' know the Daily Mirror an ' The Sun , an ITV an ' the Unions , what are they tellin ' people to do ? They just tell them to go out an ' get more money , do n't they ? But they do n't want more money , ; it 's like me , is n't it ? Y ' know , buyin ' new dresses all the time , is n't it ? The Unions tell them to go out an ' get more money an ' ITV an ' the papers tell them what to spend it on so the disease is always covered up . I 'm just tellin ' y ' about round our way . I wan na be on this course findin ' out . You know what I learn from you , about art an ' literature , it feeds me , inside . I can get through the rest of the week if I know I 've got comin ' here to look forward to . Comment Rita is a lively observer of her world , and describes it with vivid insight . She has seen who 's pulling the strings . The speech is not a lamenting " downer " , it 's full of irony , humour and compassion and honest indignation . She bursts with vitality and raw intelligence . Though she has had little education , her vocabulary is excellent : she fountains out ideas and observations at breathless speed . A smart , sexy , brave and warm young woman . The locale is described as a university in the north of England , it could be anywhere from Nottingham to Newcastle , but seems more likely to be Lancashire or Merseyside . The accent must be scrupulously well done : it 's her truth , her vocal identity , her prison . Training at drama school All training for the theatre is aiming to produce a person with all-round performing skills , equipped and ready to work in the world of entertainment . It is easy to understand this , but it 's not so easy to evaluate the different elements of theatre training , and see just how they contribute to the making of that elusive thing , " a compleat actor " . I have always considered drama training to be based on simple precepts , for acting is not a complicated art . It may be difficult , but it is not complicated , and if it gets complicated there is something quite wrong . Above all acting is not an intellectual occupation , though a good mind is needed to respond imaginatively and practically to the work of authors and directors . An actor can wear his cap as an academic in private conversation as well as the next person , but once on stage the actor responds to the requirements of a scene being played , and works through from moment to moment . And the fact that you already have a good instinct for acting will probably have been the main reason why you passed your entrance audition for drama school . What you will eventually be working towards is a fusion of instinct and technique , and training is very largely to do with improving technical skills . At drama school , there is constant attention to a student 's control of both voice and movement , and the different departments work at developing a student 's overall acting technique . The emphasis will be on developing an actor 's mental and physical concentration , and giving him/ her sufficient craftsmanship to sustain a performance . Classes The first term is always an unsettling time , and it generally takes a few weeks before students become familiar with each other , and work together effectively . Classes are carefully time-tabled throughout the day , and occasionally stretch into the evenings . It is usual for a class to consist of between 12 and 16 students divided approximately equally between male and female , and this size of class is likely to be maintained throughout the training course until the finals period in the last two terms . The two-year diploma course student will , of course , join the finals group earlier than the three-year course student . But in the first term all students start from the base line , and take many classes , individual tutorials and work on production projects . The classes will generally be in voice , movement , improvisation , dancing , fencing , mask-work , make-up and acting exercises . There will probably also be some classes in radio , television and film techniques and perhaps singing too , but by far the largest proportion of time will be allotted to the production exercise which is part of every term 's work . Most classes last for an hour or perhaps an hour and a half . In the first term , rehearsals for the production project will usually be around two hours in length , but progressively more time will be spent on this aspect of the course as the student advances . Ideally the classes support the work done on the production project and it is particularly valuable if there is strong liaison between voice and movement tutors with the director of a project -- not least in helping students see how the instructional classes connect with their own performances . If drama schools do not incorporate a stage management course , basic lectures and some participation in production work may take place in the senior terms . It is always useful for a student of acting to have some practical knowledge of stage management , helping him/ her to appreciate the need for efficient technical support for any production . And it can be particularly useful to have some background in this area , as a first job may often be that of an " acting ASM " -- particularly if you join a small touring group or a Theatre in Education company . The voice and the body It 's not much use thinking of the voice without the body , even though each is the subject of a separate training class . The days when the voice was trained to be a beautiful sound in itself are no longer with us ; instead , the emphasis is on a more natural approach , with each actor discovering the true quality of his/ her own voice , and extending its range as much as possible . After all , the voice is an actor 's number one asset , and it will be in use all the time . posture and physical balance have a great deal to contribute to vocalisation , a point which is stressed in Cicely Berry 's standard book , The Voice and the Actor , which is used as a basic text in drama schools . The use of the voice in conjunction with the body is an important feature of training , too , for when acting you will need to be physically free enough to do several things at once . But besides this more obvious point , there are subtler connections between voice and body : Cicely Berry observes that " an introverted and thoughtful person often finds more difficulty in speaking and does not carry the thought through into the physical process of making speech " . She says , too , " you have to relate the mental intention to the physical action " . Most drama training works on the assumption that there is something called " standard English " , which is generally considered to be the " straight " delivery of words without affectation or regional variation . This means that actors are expected to be able to control any regional or foreign accent which is natural to them , and deliver a text in what may best be called " the classical style " . It does n't mean that your regional accent is going to be bullied out of you , so that you are unable to use it ever again -- on the contrary , your accent may in all probability be your most interesting and valuable possession . And good voice training will make your natural delivery sound ten times better than when you first started training . A word here about singing -- some schools have courses in choral singing , and may also run individual classes ; not all students are singers , obviously , but it is always a useful addition to other vocal training . And a trained singing voice is undoubtedly a valued asset -- there may well be some competition for a place on singing tutorials . The first production The text for the first term 's production will usually be selected for the purpose of getting a new group to work together rather than trying to go for detailed individual performances . The range is obviously very wide , and you may find yourself in a Greek tragedy , or even a modern " exercise " play such as Games by James Saunders , where the student may add to the text by research material which can be incorporated in the project . Either way , the main intention will be to establish a way of working , and to begin assessing students ' voice and movement abilities . The language of a classical play is challenging but it does give the student chance to see how early voice training can be used with a very demanding text . Most of these exercises are double cast so that there are good opportunities for several readings of the main characters . Depending on the school , a full term 's work of ten to twelve weeks may be spent on one production project during the first term , with either a workshop or text study area at the end of the period . Later on there will be a regular division of the term into two projects . The new student does not perform to audiences immediately , and the first term 's production project will probably only be attended by staff teaching voice , movement and acting to enable individual assessments to be made on training . Improvisation There have been many books written about improvisation and if I were asked to choose just one it would be Keith Johnston 's Impro which is straightforward , understandable , and theatrically aware . Nowadays , nearly every young person has probably had some experience of basic improvisation at their school or through the extensive TIE ( Theatre in Education ) tours . In drama schools , improvisation is about finding a way of expanding the imagination and liberating the senses , which can get too confined if students work entirely from a text all the time . The use of impro in training has gone through many phases ; it still conjures up the traditional , hackneyed image of a student being asked to be a tree or an icecream . But it 's possible to go way beyond these limited , obvious exercises , and impro can be immensely exciting for young actors , allowing them to grasp situations and emotions imaginatively , perhaps for the first time . Here is an example of an impro exercise for two actors : " An actor is asked to assume the character of a close family friend who arrives at the house with the news of the death of the wife 's husband in an accident . He has hurried to get there and tell the wife before the police arrive . " This may prove more effective if the girl playing the wife has no idea of what the scene is going to be about . What an impro of this kind does is confront the actors with a situation where they have to be emotionally truthful . Without a text to assist them they may prevaricate too long before facing the brutal truth . Improvisation can mean having the guts to experience anything which is asked of you . Can you truthfully become a child again ? Improvisation should not , in any way , be confused with the rather general idea of " making things up as you go along " , which has no real purpose beyond that of entertainment . Improvisation , if used properly , is intended to seek out something in you , and hopefully find an imaginative and emotional response . Acting exercises Acting " exercises " differ from improvisation in that students work in a less open-ended way ; the aim is to follow the intentions and actions of a character in a particular scene , often quite minutely . Of all the classes this is closest to what happens in an actual rehearsal , since it is much more concerned with the technical means of presenting a character . And class work in this area is usually referred to as " technique " or simply " acting " . For example , one exercise which I have used in class is a play called Justice by John Galsworthy . Here a single actor plays an imprisoned man , and performs in silence , and the scene culminates in an emotional breakdown where the prisoner beats on the door of his cell . Galsworthy gives very precise details on the dimensions of the cell , the things that are in it and the character 's sequence of actions . The piece tests the actor 's awareness and imagination to the full , but nevertheless makes precise demands on him : he must follow exactly what the author says . Throughout drama school there will be continuous work on acting solo pieces , and both singing and acting tutorials are usually conducted on a one to one basis ( more on tutorials in chapter 7 ) . Of course the student also needs to learn how to co-ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary actions and movements which are part of the natural traffic of performance , and learn about prop handling . Classes help the actor to gain confidence in dealing with many things happening at the same time , and this is an important part of student work . Radio , television and film classes Most schools now offer classes on radio , television and film techniques . Radio acting makes specific technical demands on an actor , and classes are usually held by professional tutors who have a wide experience of radio drama and its production . Getting used to acting with the voice only and knowing how to use the microphone are basic features of good radio technique . Students may compete for the BBC Carlton Hobbs award which is given annually to two students from any of the drama schools ; the award offers a six month contract with BBC radio , as well as guaranteeing that vital entry into British Equity . The facilities available for television training differs from school to school ; filming and television work is expensive to organise , and really there is not so much opportunity as one would like to see for students to gain experience in these vital areas . However , where facilities are available for use over short periods of time , the rudiments of camera acting are taught in a structured way . ( Some schools have been able to co-ordinate work with the National Film School , where a script has been written for the personalities in a group and then filmed on location , and this worked effectively . ) But it 's true to say that most actors feel their drama school training has left them inadequately prepared for working in television and film by the time they graduate . Your drama school experience The work of a drama school is necessarily highly disciplined -- and indeed self discipline is an essential requirement in all acting . It is possible , though , that in the early stages of training you may feel that all your creative skill is being stripped from you , and that the whole system is ganging up on you . It 's certainly true that the pressure on you builds up as the terms go on -- but training is not designed to destroy you , but to challenge you . Remember this when the pace hots up ! Students usually find that the first term 's work is relatively gentle . At nearly all schools no stage performances will be seen by an audience until at least the end of the second term . Sometimes students get anxious about this , and believe they are not making audience contact early enough ; but if you think about it , the reasoning is clear . Most of your technical tutors will be seeing everything you do , and deriving what they need to know from it ; they do n't want to find you confused by criticism from senior students which might not be helpful to you at this point . Ultimately , there are things in your training which you will accept -- and those you may reject . And this is true of all training in the arts because nobody -- no tutor , no establishment , however excellent , can finally lay down rules . They can only suggest concepts and invite you to use them . The drama school training will only lay the foundations and prepare you for the profession you are joining . You will know about using the voice and body and know how not to exhaust yourself . Good training is there to support you and help you grow as an actor -- and usually , it works . And at the end of the day I have always found that the training programme is open to genuine ideas -- in all the classes the aim is to build and shape the existing talent so that the actor can work effectively and truthfully when faced with any situation . Finally , here are some reminders -- it may sound like a do 's and don'ts column , but these are important things to remember . So I 'll just list them : 1 Do n't be late -- anywhere or for anything . Punctuality is not just a drama school fetish , it 's preparation for a profession where time really does cost money . 2 Learn lines accurately -- and always carry a pencil with you . 3 If you have a question about acting , think about it before you ask it . 4 Read newspapers , and do n't assume that the whole world is as interested in acting as you are . 5 Do n't neglect your health . And do n't imagine that you are too sick to attend classes that you do n't like . 6 Think about your appearance , and how you present yourself as a person . 7 Watch how other people behave ; remember everything is useful to the actor . 8 Go the theatre whenever you can . The final year The final terms at drama school are vital and exciting . This is the time you have worked towards , when you will be working on the " showcase " productions which will provide opportunities for you to be seen publicly . The last three months particularly are charged with electricity -- and you are suddenly involved both in the throes of final productions and the " business " of acting ; it all comes together in a thrilling rush , and the time goes quickly . There do n't seem to be enough hours in the day to do all the things you have to do , quite apart from your laundry ! " Showcase " productions Depending on the school 's theatre resources , a full term of productions may mean that at least three or more plays will be staged , giving agents , directors and casting pundits a chance to evaluate your work . Students may find themselves performing in final productions over two full terms , which means they have the opportunity to play twice as many parts , but this depends on the school 's policy and how they think you have progressed . At this stage , too , the allocation of parts and the standard of performance is becoming a lot more competitive -- a foretaste of the profession itself . In many cases students will also tour in productions mounted by the school , and this gives good audience experience away from the greenhouse of school performances , where the people who sit in the audience are usually either professionally interested , or are fellow students and friends . Any programme of final drama school productions will present a variety of styles and the casting is aimed at giving students a chance to do well in suitable roles . Naturally , with a cast of actors who are all approximately the same age , the casting of heavy character parts has to be considered very carefully , and of course not all plays are teeming with characters of similar age . Both classical and contemporary plays will be chosen , but problems are often encountered with the modern play which frequently has a short cast list . A finals company usually means there are some fourteen or sixteen students , or more , to be placed . It is possible for two productions to be mounted so that numbers are divided -- possibly four productions may be put on , if that is thought worthwhile . Arguably the modern play with a limited cast is more effective in drawing in professional agents and casting directors since there are fewer " bit " parts for students to get lost in . ( On the other hand , plays like Tom Stoppard 's Jumpers or Max Frisch 's Andorra offer good opportunities for large numbers of students . ) Quite clearly the most important thing about final presentations is that the play suits the talent available in the group . Yet every now and again a student emerges who shows exceptional talent and it is quite natural that a drama school will make sure that his/ her ability is given a good stretch in public with a major role , perhaps playing Hamlet or Hedda Gabler . Some students , there is no denying , are more charismatic and powerful on stage than others -- and it is always very difficult for the system to be absolutely fair . However , one thing worth mentioning at this point is that the larger parts are not always a guarantee of an agent 's interest -- quite often big roles will attract attention , but a student who has been very well cast in a smaller role may hit the mark just as effectively . Many drama schools regard musical productions as a main attraction , and shows such as Cabaret , Guys and Dolls and Chicago often get presented very well , with good choreography and musical direction which supports the cast very well . The ability to sing and dance has become increasingly important in the profession nowadays , and there are few actors who do n't possess some musical and dance skills . Productions such as Oh , What a Lovely War offer many opportunities for voice and body training to be displayed effectively , particularly as the quick character sketches in this show mean that an actor may play several parts in one evening . Press notices are , however , exceptionally rare these days . Once The Stage covered all finals productions from the drama schools , but now they may write up a play perhaps once a year . This is a pity , as it means that students find it harder to get their names known , and it means they lose out on a degree of publicity . The private tutorial In the last terms of the diploma course students often find tutorials , where they are given opportunity to talk about work in progress , enormously valuable . The tutorial is completely distinct from an " audition " class ; the object of the tutorial is to help a student concentrate on speeches and scenes which may extend aspects of characterisation or improve his/ her vocal range , and also to increase confidence . They are personal work-out sessions . Altogether , tutorials take place over a period of about twenty-four weeks in the last year of a course , and usually by the last twelve tutorials a student has a much clearer idea of what he or she is about . Where the tutorial focuses on current productions , I have found that students will work hard on their performances and be open about their work and any problems they may be having with the characters they are playing . A director may have made it plain that he has a definite intention for a character , but the student may not always see this straight away . Discussing a character and finding an outline of what is required in a half hour tutorial can save a lot or time on a tight rehearsal schedule . But a tutorial need not be directly connected with a production in rehearsal . The student may want to find out more about the kind of parts he/ she may play in the future , or indeed may have played during the time already spent at drama school . Perhaps certain parts played in the past have not succeeded , and it may be possible to investigate why . It is common for students to return to a part that has given them many ideas , and to rework a passage fruitfully . And in tutorials there is opportunity to take well judged risks -- by which I mean being unafraid of going for the character and seeing where it leads -- even with well known speeches . Some students will use the time to try out major speeches they have never attempted before , and find out where this may take them . So the tutorial is a place for ideas as well as practice , and if they are well used they can help an actor to be more objective about the craft . Agents Drama school productions are staged with an awareness of the kind of demands the profession will make , and students are naturally anxious to be seen in the final production by people who 're likely to offer them work . Unfortunately , it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions . Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of schedule , which means agents are asked to see students ' work over a fairly compressed period . Agents are notified of performances by the schools , and they also receive hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances . Remember , though , that badgering agents is quite useless ; if they want to come they will come , but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working . It will be the same story for many moons to come . Most of the drama schools now include a presentation of auditions for agents and managements at the end of the final term , in addition to the finals productions . This means that students then have the chance to present themselves as they would at a working audition , and this is often quite a good place to attract attention . Although an agent may be very impressed by the talent he sees , there are practical difficulties which affect how much agents can do for young actors . The whole thorny question of Equity membership is linked with the step from drama school to agent 's office -- and indeed applies equally at the audition for the first job . But the positive interest of an agent is some guarantee that your work is not passing by unnoticed . An agent looking at a student actor makes a reasonable commercial judgement ; he considers whether a decision to take on an actor will be financially justified . Agents do n't want deadwood and if they are interested in you it is because they feel they can sell you into the market , so that you can go on and make money both for yourself and them . They are not artistic philanthropists , but business people who are necessary to the profession . If that makes the agent sound unpleasant it is only because you are still seeing the profession through rose-coloured spectacles . As a student in your last term you will begin to send out letters and photographs of yourself to all possible valuable contacts . Who are these ? Well , the agents and the casting directors are one thing , then there 's an amorphous list of anyone who seems to be connected with theatre , film and television . If any professional person has shown an interest in your work do n't let it go , but try to cultivate their interest , however tenuous it may seem -- you will soon know if it 's going to be any use for the future . In the first place you are your own agent . You are entering the market for the first time when you write a letter about yourself to either agent , casting director , producer or director . If an agent is interested in you he may well have useful comments on the photo you send of yourself , on your style and how you present yourself . Remember this will be a professional opinion from someone who is interested in the qualities you now have to offer , so bear such comment well in mind . The drama school will give you some advice on when and where to write to , and how you organise your letters , but outside advice is very important in helping you to see yourself in perspective . Letters and the curriculum vitae Writing letters about yourself is never easy -- we tend either to say too much or too little . Nobody wants a florid letter from someone they have never seen before but as an actor your style and personality must come through sufficiently -- a bare list of parts played wo n't convey much . Prepare details on a separate sheet of paper : your name , height , colouring , and the parts you have played in training . The accompanying letter needs to be personal and brief and should certainly not be sycophantic or name dropping . If you have particular skills like dancing , singing , fencing , acrobatics , or mime , be sure they are on this information sheet . I 've even known fire eating , sword swallowing , skiing and judo to be useful , and they are certainly eye-catching -- but be sure you really can do what you claim ! Photographs Photographs are all-important . It 's very difficult , though , to say what the right kind of photograph is , for obviously actors are very different , but remember that a good photograph is not necessarily an art photograph . The main thing is that it needs to look like you ! Not everyone suits the same kind of photographic style , and it may take several tries before you find a picture that eventually gets you noticed . You will probably , therefore , end up with a selection of varying pictures which could well be useful . Getting a good set of prints is not cheap , although there are less expensive rates for students and most actors have a stock of postcard size prints that they can send off at the merest rumour of work . You will need to send a photograph to Spotlight , too . Quality in photographs costs money but it is an outlay that is never wasted for casting directors and producers do look at volumes of Spotlight repeatedly . In recent years , photographs of newcomers to the profession have been put together in a volume expressly produced for that purpose , by Spotlight . The drama school will know about this , and make sure your picture is sent at the right time before you finish training . Equity We have already mentioned Equity , and for a number of reasons the entire question of how to enter the actors ' union needs discussion at this point . Briefly , the organisation British Actors ' Equity exists so that only bona fide members of the profession may apply for work : and those members must abide by the contractual rulings established by the Union in negotiation with managements in theatre , television and film . Equity is important in that it fights for improvements and fairness in pay and working conditions , and with over 44,000 members competing for probably some 5-7,000 jobs in any given working week , it tries to ensure that the work goes to professionally accredited people , those with training or suitable professional experience . Equity entry is of crucial concern to the large numbers of trained and talented drama school finalists seeking to enter the business every year . Membership of Equity , then , is no guarantee of employment -- it simply gives the member a chance to be considered for the work that is available . No new actor should expect more . There are those who think that all drama students who graduate from drama school should be given an Equity card when they receive their diploma ; to me , this is naive . The present situation in 1990 is that would-be members can become provisional members by the following means ; by being offered an engagement by any company or management which operates under the " Quota " system by agreement with Equity and the Theatre Managers ' Association . That is , the employer will have places for a very small number of newcomers to the profession who are not yet union members . On taking up the job , the applicant will be granted provisional membership of Equity . The employers with a quota will mainly be Regional Repertories , children 's theatres , touring companies , theatre-in-education , or young people 's theatre companies , and strangely , the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford and Chichester Festival Theatre . There is no quota for the West-End Theatre , The National Theatre , television , commercials , films or radio . Those with training in other performance skills , variety , singers and dancers , should consult Equity about the means whereby they could qualify for membership . Summer seasons , pantomime and certain Fringe or small-scale companies also have a quota for performers and assistant stage managers and acting ASMs . In addition to the quota system , Equity have compiled a " Graduate Register " . The drama student , on successfully completing an acting or stage management training course at an NCDT accredited school registers with Equity , thereby becoming eligible for membership of the union if offered an engagement in any of the areas of work listed above . It 's tough to get into the union , and it 's tough to earn a living in the profession . An Open Sesame to all comers would make it even tougher . The ball is not with the union or the performer but with those who fund the Arts . A determined , skilful young actor can get an Equity card and a first job . What comes after is the problem . The new actor Once you have left drama school your attention will be on the immediate problems of survival and making progress with your work . Most new actors have tremendous optimism , as indeed they must , for without belief in themselves training is just a huge waste of time . Remember that drama school has only prepared you to work . Your diploma is a mark of that preparation -- nothing more and nothing less . Clive Swift , in his admirable and essential book The Job of Acting says that when you were at drama school " you were a big fish -- now you 're a tiddler " . But being in an overcrowded profession does n't mean that you wo n't be considered . New faces are arriving all the time and in some cases actors make a quick start with a first job or they may have a relatively long wait before they get off the mark . This is true in more ways than simply obtaining an Equity card . If you are fortunate enough to have secured an agent you will have someone with whom you can talk . Your agent will want you to be working , but they can not perform miracles for you . It will be up to you to write constantly and make contacts everywhere and you will largely be responsible for yourself . You always have your agent to refer to should anyone make you an offer . If you have had problems finding an agent , you might consider the possibility of applying to join a co-operative where actors work together and run their own agency . These can offer real support to new actors seeking their first taste of work and such co-ops do show enormous interest in the work of drama students in their last term . It 's difficult to evaluate how successful such co-ops are but many do seem to gain work on a fairly reasonable basis for their members , and they are certainly worth considering . Most students find that the first job does eventually come along , and even that elusive Equity card is attainable . Your first Equity card will be a provisional one ; to become a full member you need to have worked for at least 30 weeks , not necessarily consecutively , Nevertheless , it 's only realistic to assume that you may face longish periods of unemployment and to be prepared to deal with this constructively . Isolation is one of the biggest problems for the unemployed actor , for acting is something which needs communication with others . The actor is dependent on the stimulus of other faces and voices . Quite a number of new actors form small fringe groups and work in plays on a profit sharing basis -- and work opportunities may grow from such schemes . Small , little-known groups do n't generally muster a large audience , of course , but they are often a good way of commanding interest from future employers . Certainly the new actor should never remain idle but create chances wherever possible . This may sound like cold comfort when you 're desperately hoping for something to come along and get you going -- but continuing your work and maintaining skills is vitally important . Above all you need new audience experience now you are out of drama school . And , although nobody wishes to be exploited with low wages and very difficult conditions , it is frankly better to find the ways and means of presenting yourself somehow , than not perform at all . The new actor is generally operating in top gear and if this momentum is stopped it can be very damaging to the morale and can result in an actor 's technical skills going rusty -- something to be avoided at all costs . To speak of further training programmes now may sound like a mere desperate remedy , but it does n't mean anything as arduous or as expensive as the full training of your drama school . Actors who are serious about their work always look on the voice and movement class as an important part of their life . It is , and keeping yourself in trim is very important when you 're not working . A ballet dancer who does not practise every day loses a lot of skill , as does a musician . The actor is no different , although for some reason it is often thought that you are somehow ready to act , magically , the moment you enter a stage door . Look after yourself , and particularly your voice and your memory , for without these you are dead meat . So much of professional life is spent in the competitive atmosphere of interviews and auditions that a chance to work on themselves constructively and together is something actors relish . Since 1980 professional training courses have proliferated and many can be found in and around London . All of them take the working actors ' problems into account and attempt to create classes which can make free hours both disciplined and profitable . The Actors ' Centre in Covent Garden has functioned since 1980 , and offers a variety of professional classes in a relaxed atmosphere . It also caters for those who want more intensive sessions . For movement and dance , the Pineapple Studios in the same part of town seems to be one of the best there is , though it is not intended primarily for dancers and actors -- people from all sorts of professions come along to keep fit . RADA holds regular annual classes for the professional during vacation periods ; they offer refresher classes in both voice and movement which many actors find extremely valuable . Everything in this chapter may seem terribly grey and pessimistic , but the truth is that acting is probably the most optimistic of all professions -- it is the nature of actors to hope . However tough things seem , it 's vital that you should keep your spirits up , and remember that acting is an art and a thrilling one -- though sometimes when you are struggling with the frustrating process of building a career , this can all get a bit obscured . Conversations The following conversations with a handful of actors centred mainly on their attitudes to drama training , and their opinions about the audition system . Different generations are well represented here , from the newest professional at the beginning of her career to two who have been in the business for the last forty years . Interestingly enough , having once entered the profession itself , age ceases to be a barrier , for actors of any age may easily teach each other something and share emotions honestly . All the actors interviewed seemed to feel , and state quite naturally and simply that there was really nothing else for them to do but act . None of them were particularly concerned with " glamour " . What does stand out is that everyone believes that the profession , its standards and its aims , matter , and they all feel an excitement about the job of acting . All are concerned with practical issues such as the accessibility of the union to those who are coming into the profession and the need to find sensible ways of selecting actors for parts . They voice real criticism of the way things are managed both artistically and in terms of employment . I wish to express my sincerest thanks to " all those taking part " , and for giving me their time . For fairly obvious reasons the conversations begin with one of the most recent entrants to the profession , and ends with the two most senior actors . Jenny Funnell Trained at Webber Douglas Academy . She won the 1984 Carlton Hobb 's Radio Award at the BBC and completed a contract with the Repertory Company in July 1985 . Prior to this she played Ophelia in both Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead for Theatr Clwyd and on tour . Also played Anna in Self-inflicted Wounds by Tom Kempinski . A. R . Although you won the BBC radio competition for a place in the BBC Repertory company straight from drama school , you decided to start your career by playing Ophelia in Hamlet at Theatr Clwyd . Do you feel that was the right way round for you ? J. F. Yes , I do . I was terribly excited of course , to win the BBC competition but I do feel that going into the theatre first was a great help . Doing Ophelia on stage before taking up the BBC contract meant that I went there with a little track record -- I 'd been blooded , if you like , and it made the whole thing a lot better . A. R . Tell me about your audition to get Ophelia . J. F. Well , I 'd thought a lot about the part . I knew I would n't play her as a wimp and the whole audition was based on the speech where she goes mad -- the flowers , rosemary for remembrance and the whole bit . George Roman read me and after I 'd done the first reading he asked me about my own attitudes to the Part and then told me his as a director , which were completely different . So I asked if I might go through it again and try some of the ideas he talked about . A. R . Did you find it easy to take direction from someone whom you did n't know ? J. F. Yes . Because that 's where I realised that the drama school training helped a lot . When you 're training you have ideas shoved at you continually and are expected to change quickly -- which is a very good thing . A. R . Did your experience at drama school come as a great surprise to you ? J. F. Well , it did really . I had n't a clue what was expected . I had n't done " drama " at school , thank God , so I was completely open coming straight from school . There were a lot of people older than me with more experience of life . A. R . Do you think it a good idea coming into drama training direct from school ? J. F It was for me . I 'd been trying to get into training since I was fourteen . A. R That 's a bit early . J. F. I realise that now . But it 's all I ever wanted to do . Most of my family is in the medical profession and doctors always seem to be full of drama . My twin sister is a nurse and I suppose all the blood and thunder of things took me a different way . It was three years later that I did finally audition , at seventeen . I did the well trodden path , with phoebe in As You Like It . A R Did you ever play that part ? J. F. No . When the school did do a production I played Celia . A. R . So you played quite a bit in the classics during training . J. F. I finished by playing Isabella in a production of Women Beware Women in a 1950 's style which may have helped when I came to my Ophelia , which was loosely based on a Princess Di concept . But I think my most rewarding part at drama school was Carol in David Storey 's play Sisters . A. R . Do you have a preference for classical acting or the modern theatre at the moment ? J. F. I always wanted to do the heavy parts . But I love playing comedy and then I 'm not very tall . Perhaps radio will allow me to play all the unsuitable roles that I ca n't do visually in the theatre , where it 's just the voice and the character . A. R . What did you do for the BBC competition ? J. F. We had to do four pieces with different accents and a piece of real sight reading of poetry without any time to look at it . And then six of us did an extract from Great Expectations . A. R . What about television training ? Did the drama school include any of that ? J. F Oh , yes . We did a fortnight 's production which I enjoyed immensely . I hated seeing myself at first -- we all did . But it was n't as bad as I thought it might be . A. R . Do you think drama school should include more training for television and film ? J F Definitely more for television . But I prefer the stage really . I like the feeling of doing it " now " rather than it being a recording . A. R . Can you say what the best things are from your drama school experience and what has been of most value to you during your first year in the profession ? J. F. The voice teaching and knowing how to keep yourself ready vocally ; that really is the most important thing , which you do n't realise when you start out . And singing is part of that too -- I did n't sing before I went into training even though I am musical and play both the piano and the flute . But being trained to use your singing voice is really good . Perhaps some of the voice teaching was repetitive in the second term , but when there was a change in voice tutor who developed pieces of your own choice rather than just vocal exercises the whole thing came alive and interesting . I think that drama school stops you playing safe too early on in life and encourages you to take risks . I think if you do n't go to train and still find your way into the profession some of the essential things you need to know about and be able to do will take that much longer to achieve . Amanda Root Trained at Webber Douglas Academy . Her first job was in 1983 with the Leeds Playhouse Company , playing Essie in The Devil 's Disciple by Bernard Shaw . She followed this by joining the Royal Shakespeare Company on tour playing Juliet and later repeating this performance in the Other Place at Stratford upon Avon . While in Stratford she also played Jessica in The Merchant of Venice and Moth in Love 's Labours Lost . Recent work includes a television play This Lightning Always Strikes Twice and the play Dragons . A. R . Were you surprised how soon you got into the RSC -- and that you have now ended up after only just over a year and a half in the profession playing Juliet and Hermia ? AMANDA I was amazed ! It all happened so quickly -- sometimes I think it may have been too quickly . The only other experience I had was playing Essie in Shaw 's play The Devil 's Disciple at Leeds ... A. R . For which you auditioned with your drama school prepared pieces or by reading for the part ? AMANDA No . By reading for the part and an interview . My first audition , as such , was actually for John Caird who wanted me to do a piece of Juliet . I only had twenty four hours ' notice and then I sat up all night learning a speech and then dried flat at the audition . So they asked me to go away and come back again in a week which gave me breathing space and time at least to learn it properly . A. R . What speeches did you choose to do ? AMANDA For Juliet I did " Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face " and for Hermia I did the " puppet " speech . You know , all aggro and spirit . And that got me into the last three so I had to do it all again at the Barbican which I think was to see if I could fill that theatre with enough presence and vocal range . It was all terrifically exciting and when I got the parts I could hardly believe it . A. R On reflection , do you think the audition process is a good one ? AMANDA Well , I haven t had enough experience of it yet . Having been lucky with the only real audition I did which was for the RSC , I ca n't really complain about it . But I think it 's probably different for different people . I mean , sight reading is another thing and not everyone is good at that , but it helps if you are . My audition for Leeds was a sight reading job and it 's something that you get from drama training -- work that helps you cope with the sight reading at an audition -- yes . I mean , radio work classes helped a lot in that respect . A R Did you have any experience of a kind that helped you before you came to drama school ? AMANDA It 's very daunting to have to go to an audition for the first time in your life . And you 're not sure what is expected . I mean I had no idea that by doing " I left no ring with her " by Viola I was doing something that must have been heard a hundred times that day -- I had no idea . A. R . Had you always wanted to be an actor ? AMANDA Well , yes , I think I must have done . I used to watch television and think " I want to do that " . All very clich�d but true . At school I did English and Art , and looked at theatre design in art -- it was all pointing the same way , really . Of course at school they always tell you that you should do a secretarial course , which was absolutely dreadful , and they put you off the idea of a career in the theatre just as much as they can . A. R . Is classical training the most important ingredient for today 's student ? You have come into a classical company which makes sense of that training but what other ingredients do you think vital ? AMANDA I think in a company like the RSC you are privileged and you go on learning all the time . It 's like an extension of your training , with bigger resources and bigger audiences with which to practise and share the way you work . That 's what 's so marvellous . Particularly in doing a great part like Juliet which we toured in all kinds of places before coming here to the Other Place venue . A. R . As a new young actor do you find that at Stratford you become part of a house style ? AMANDA I do n't think there 's a style of voice , thank goodness . But there is the chance of working with Cicely Berry , who is so wonderful at adding in a positive , performance orientated way to all the things you have learnt about voice . And of course holding together a part like Juliet with long gaps between the performance nights and no real rehearsal in between is difficult to do -- that can be rather hairy . Sometimes you 're a week away from the last performance you gave and then find yourself out there -- so that the voice and understanding of the part does need constant refreshing . That 's the big lesson . One is always in a state of learning -- if you stop learning it 's hopeless , I feel . A. R . What do you feel about working in the more modern style of play after your classical work with Stratford ? AMANDA Yes . There 's lots of new plays being written that I look at and say " Oh yes -- there 's lots of opportunities there " . I mean , Sugar and Spice for example by Nigel Williams ; I 'd love to have a go at doing the part of Sharon sometime , I think anything that is well written -- that 's important . A. R . Being well written ? AMANDA Yes . Perhaps doing Shakespeare spoils you for that , but I think having a text that is good is important . We ought to do more modern work at drama school , as well as the classics . I remember doing the Stoppard play Undiscovered Country which was a great help and drama school needs to do more of that sort of thing . We need to be of " now " and maybe that 's a better way of playing " then " . A. R The past is often reflected by something called documentary drama , which uses improvisation before arriving at a script in its final state . What do you feel about that ? AMANDA Yes . I loved all that . But improvising round a text and its written characters , finding out about their intentions is very exciting too . When I went to drama school it was all very new to me so I did n't have any real comparisons to make -- which is a good thing . I think you have to see what the system is and then see how you get it to work for yourself . A. R . Are there aspects of training that you find to have been missing or superficial now that you have had the chance of putting your technical skill to the test ? AMANDA I think the training has been basically good . I do think there 's a greater need for other aspects to be included -- like the Alexander technique , which helps with your body control . For example , I had no idea about playing scenes on a raked stage , which can throw your weight out in placement very considerably . Being technically aware of your body is very important and the more drama school does about that the better . Kenneth Branagh Trained at RADA . Played Judd in Another Country as almost his first job , following this with Francis , the title role in a new play at Greenwich Theatre . joined the Royal Shakespeare Company playing Henry V , Laertes and King of Navarre in Love 's Labours Lost at Stratford upon Avon and in the Barbican Theatre , London . Television includes Too Late to Talk to Billy , To the Lighthouse and The Boy in the Bush . A. R . Did you go straight from school into actor training ? K. B . Yes . I thought it was better going to drama school direct rather than via a university and if you 're going to act I think that 's the way . Before going to RADA I had been encouraged at my school in school plays , which included Oh , What a Lovely War . I also did a great deal of amateur acting with the Progress Theatre in Reading . A. R . Was getting into RADA an audition process that you enjoyed , coming as you did straight from school . K. B . Well , I must admit there 's a bit of me that thrives slightly on the exam syndrome -- something that gets the adrenalin flowing rather like " first nights " . A bit gladiatorial , I suppose one might say -- a sort of us and them feeling . But getting into RADA was quite a searching process and I remember doing four one-hour work sessions with some of the tutors there , including the Principal , before finally being accepted for the three-year course there . Now I think that 's the right way to get to know the kind of talent there is , rather than a straight knock-down audition . It was more humane . A. R . Once you had been through the three years what did you find had developed most for you as an actor ? K. B . Leaving drama school you do feel as though you are really in control of your destiny . You can at least organise your life around your aims and ambitions . I must have prepared some twelve pieces for possible auditions . A. R . That 's quite a lot -- quite a programme of work . As a young actor you obviously went for a great deal of variety in characters and accents . K. B . Oh , yes ... my American piece , my Irish and the modern funny and modern serious -- the same with the classics . Always varied . As an auditionee I knew I worked best if I attempted something outrageous so I prepared Lord Foppington from The Relapse and you just have to let go with his Lordship otherwise there 's no point to it . I also put together an adaptation of my own from The Pickwick Papers in which I took on four characters all travelling in a coach together , then mixed it with the narration , rather as they did with the production of Nicholas Nickleby . I enjoyed doing this because it took people by surprise . A. R . Did you get your first job from an audition ? K. B . Well , my first job came during four weeks of my last term at RADA when I had applied and been chosen for a television play called It 's Too Late to Talk to Billy which was set in Belfast -- which is where I came from originally . So the accent was no problem and I was the right age . It gave me a temporary Equity card -- mind you they took it away again as soon as I had done the four weeks work . A. R . And when you went back to RADA you finished your final term with what ? K. B . I played Hamlet , which was a wonderful chance . It got me noticed here although I think the one-man show I did outside on my own was the real deciding factor with the RSC . A. R . What was the one-man show about ? K. B . I took the dramatic Poem Maud by Tennyson -- all fourteen hundred lines -- and learnt them and presented them working with two friends , a designer and a lighting man . It was a great experience . A. R . Your first stage part was in something quite different from the classical roles , was n't it ? K. B . Yes . I had the chance to audition for the transfer to London cast of Another Country which requires young actors to play seventeen-year-olds . Again , there were difficulties with Equity when I was selected and the whole thing had to go to arbitration because the company stood out for the casting it wanted . A. R . Equity seems to have been prominent in your career very early on . Do you think the entry into Equity for drama students is unfairly organised ? K. B . I do think there should be better arrangements for students leaving to audition and get Provisional cards and not always be intimidated by the " Equity only " requirement at auditions . If not a provisional card another way of permission to be seen properly at meaningful auditions . After all , having a card is n't Pamela Salem Trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London , which was followed by repertory theatre in various parts of the country , national tours , and theatre abroad , Vienna , Stockholm , the Caribbean , and a British Council tour of Betrayal in Switzerland and Portugal . Her recent television credits include leads in the series Buccaneer , The Professionals , The Consultant , Into the Labyrinth , Lytton 's Diary , Magnum , Seagull Island , and her film credits include The First Great Train Robbery , The Bitch , Morecambe and Wise 's Night Train to Murder , Miss Moneypenny in Never Say Never Again , Universal City , After Darkness , and she has just completed Salome , playing Herodias . A. R . Would you say that things have changed a great deal from the days when you finished your drama school training at Central in 1966 ? P. S. I think the profession has changed because the opportunities are different . first of all I 'm absolutely against having the controlled entry into Equity . It is much worse these days than it was in 1966 . Things should be made easier ; after all actors come from all walks of life and we should n't keep them out . They should have a provisional card for Equity at the beginning of their career . A. R . You mean that drama students who are graduating from training should have the chance to join Equity ? P. S. Certainly they should . Actors who train and go to drama school are usually on grants from local education authorities and to deny them the chance to join the profession -- or at least compete properly -- is ridiculous . After all , becoming a provisional member of Equity does n't give them work , it merely gives them the opportunity to work in the career for which they have trained . A. R . We 've plunged in with the practical details rather than training itself . Do you think that training is essential ? P. S. Some kind of training is vital . I 'm not so sure about drama schools , sometimes . The voice and movement work is very important but the professional requirements have changed , particularly in respect of film and television and there should be more training in this area . We had next to none when I was at drama school and young actors need to know more about what will be expected of them on film sets and television studios . And young actors have a greater instinct these days for film than they do for the stage , though this is not to say that stage training is not equally important ; nevertheless as working actors we are getting more and more camera conscious in our acting and will continue to do so . A. R . Would you say that with so much emphasis on film and the camera , theatre training is becoming less important ? P. S. No . We have to remember that many of the new actors will find their first work in the theatre . I think there are questions of style and dimension which come down to what type of theatre you are talking about . Many actors start in the fringe productions -- in small theatres almost as intimate as television , material concentrating on highly detailed reality . Personally I 'm not sure that highly detailed reality is what the theatre is truly about . The film does that so much better . A. R . The theatre is always larger than life , is n't it ? P. S. Much . Which is why I think naturalistic plays with domestic situations need very careful handling . They are so like the television it 's sometimes hard to see why they are being done on a stage . Yes , the stage is larger than life and it is about emotions that are big enough to wrap round you . The theatre is at it 's best being spectacular and for experimental new plays -- I certainly do n't think the theatre should be like television . We have problems on British television because our theatrical tradition gets in the way , so-that characters talk too much , as though the medium is only half way from the stage . Quite often the stage element in TV plays sounds phoney . And all of this is a problem facing the new actor coming out of training . A. R . What do you think existing kinds of drama training do for the new actor ? P. S. It centres the classical traditions in a way that no other kind of training can do . Drama school is n't going to teach anybody to act but it does give the vital techniques with which to act and gives you a chance to make mistakes , experiment and find out about yourself . But it should do more these days about practical matters -- like the tax system and keeping yourself together while you 're out of work and waiting for the next job , for that is fifty percent of what you 'll be doing . And , of course , working with professional directors who wo n't say things like " Your uvula is n't relaxed enough " , but simply " I ca n't hear you " . A. R . Getting into drama school is highly competitive and requires an audition and interview . Later on in the profession itself the process goes on at a different level . What do you think of the audition system generally ? P. S. Awful -- but what else can one do ? For drama school it is the first taste of things to come and on the whole a good thing . Later in the profession it can vary a great deal . If you feel you have done well at an interview and everyone seems to like you it is quite likely to find that you have n't got the part . A cold and depressing interview can mean the reverse . A. R . Have you had that experience recently ? P. S. I had an alarming reading for an Agatha Christie film where I was given several sheets of script to sight read without any logical link up in the scenes being read and no-one to read with , except an office assistant who could n't read dialogue . What was interesting was the director who said to everyone auditioning -- " Look I know you are all good actresses . I just want to get the looks right " . The audition was simply acting by numbers . A. R . And you got the part ? P. S. I got the part . A. R . What would you say is the toughest time after finishing drama school ? P. S. The second year . The first year you 're running on adrenalin and you 're going to take on the world . The second year you realise that it 's terribly , terribly hard . I remember when I left Central School in 1966 they said the average life for a woman in the theatre was three years and seven for a man before giving it up . So after four years I thought I 'd survived . A. R . What do you feel about actors keeping themselves in step with training once they are in the profession ? P. S. I think it 's very important but I think a lot of us are very lazy . But you do need to do good voice and movement workouts -- it 's like going back to the keyboard for a musician . Americans are much better at this than we are . They enquire more . They are not content to just rest on their laurels . On the whole we are , until suddenly panic reigns and we must rush to a class again and limber up . A. R . So in a way we never stop training . P. S. And that means in a way one never stops working . Patrick Ryecart Trained at Webber Douglas Academy . first major West End role was playing Marchbanks to Deborah Kerr 's Candida in 1977 . Co-presented the play The Beastley Beatitudes of Balthazar B as well as starring in it . He followed this with Jack Absolute in The Rivals at the National Theatre and David Mamet 's A Life in the Theatre with Freddie Jones at the Open Space . His television includes Romeo in the BBC Shakespeare series and most recently Silas Marner . His latest theatre has included Oberon/ Theseus in A Midsummer Nights Dream and the fascinating double Hugo/ Frederick in Anouilh 's Ring Round the Moon at the open air theatre in Regent 's park , London . A. R . What do you recall that 's most important from your days as a drama student -- which are about ten years ago ? P. R . I can remember everything . And I 've rejected nothing , but the things that happen when working expand the horizons and the understanding . The absolute discipline of drama training is one of the major things that helps you all the time . I had already been part of the theatre working as an ASM at the Cambridge Arts Theatre , not with the University but with the Prospect Theatre Company at a very exciting time . When I came to train properly I was already aware of the professional background . A. R . Did you go into drama training straight from school ? P. R Well , no . I tried an abortive term at Durham University Drama Department and that made me realise even more that I wanted the real thing ; by then I had , in any case , worked the AIM stint and I did n't need theory ; I wanted practice . A. R . Would you say that drama school is necessary if you have already made some professional contact ? P. R . I think the whole thing of being a student over three years -- the camaraderie if you like , is vital . The sharing and growing up without much money and finding a belief in yourself and the work . The student life is very important -- in perspective . A. R . You went to Hornchurch Rep for your first job ? P. R . That 's right . It was the part of Sabbo in Rope ; mind you , I had been offered two leading roles at other reps that could n't give me the vital Equity card -- so Sabbo it was . A. R . So you would say the audition work proved successful ? P. R . Not auditions as such . People had seen me in my drama school finals . No . I 'm quite hopeless at the set auditions , I think . I know it 's silly but I find it hard to take them seriously and really concentrate and not be distracted by the local cat cleaning himself on a window ledge or some such thing . I nearly always dry . Or did . A. R . Your first big stroke of fortune was playing Eugene Marchbanks in Shaw 's Candida with Deborah Kerr in the West End . P. R . And that was a tense business . It took several months for that to come home and safe . It was then that I became fully aware of how your personality is really at stake . That the audition process was one that examined you totally -- your private behaviour as well as your theatrical ability , the two feeding into each other to find a way to suit the requirements of the part and the particular aspects that were being looked at by the director , Michael Blakemore . So achieving Marchbanks was a gradual and thoughtful affair -- I remember being taken aside by the director and given a whole day after we had been rehearsing for two weeks and simply talking together about the play and about ourselves which was the real making of the part over the next weeks of final rehearsal . The audition had been one thing , the work-g through the part another -- which is something it seems very hard for the audition process to make proper allowance for . A. R . Would you say that this way of casting and rehearsal is a luxury almost exclusive to the major nationally subsidised companies like the National Theatre or the RSC ? P. R . Usually , I suppose , but Candida and Marchbanks belonged to the commercial theatre -- a straight West End run . A. R Did that part lead to the next in any way ? P. R . Yes , it did . Although the story of my doing Balthazar B and the Beastly Beatitudes is a bit strange inasmuch as I ended up playing the part that was completely opposite from the one I was originally intended to do . That had more to do with management and the presentation of the play to those who were backing it -- so instead of playing Beefy , who is described as " the world 's most beatific observer " I played the opposite number who was " the world 's last shy elegant young man " . Which was right be had no resemblance to what is commercially thought of a typecasting in any way -- it 's just that the mixture was right with Simon Callow . A. R . And later -- much later at the National Theatre playing the young Captain Absolute -- did that grow out of being seen in these performances ? P. R . I 'm sure it did . The NT is obviously interested in new talent but also in staying power -- track record in sustainment , as indeed they should . Playing a big classic like The Rivals is enormously demanding . A. R . Do you think typecasting is inevitable in one 's early days as an actor ? P. R . I think there is always an element of typecasting that is sensible , I mean it does n't have to be restrictive . In any case one person 's typecasting is n't always another 's . But , yes -- I read plays and I can see actors in the parts -- I hope I can see what is suitable to their personalities . Perhaps that is why I 'm not all that much attached to being part of a permanent company for too long -- I get bored by being around in one place for too long . I think you need a great variety of experience to build your work and need to fail as well as succeed sometimes . New actors need to try and widen their range all the time and in the same breath find a way of being commercially as well as artistically viable . I have been very lucky ; the right opportunities have come along and yet every time you take them you are looking forward immediately to the next challenge . I mean the most exciting moment of all is when you are actually chosen for a part -- after that initial excitement it 's a bit downhill -- not because the work is n't marvellous but because the first challenge is the peak . I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual performance . In the West End there seems at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actors which is often accompanied by a failure to maintain a true interest in what is going on for the actor . Perhaps directors in particular need to realise how much their vitality means to the continuing performance -- that it is n't enough to be left up on a stage merely doing it night after night . A. R . Is that something that you feel may come from the " hothouse " atmosphere of drama school in the first place ? P. R . Maybe it does . But it 's no bad thing -- we should take the two way traffic of actors and directors more seriously than we do . And a production should not just be a matter of getting a good notice and leaving it to go to seed slowly . David Suchet Trained at LAMDA . Has worked a great deal with the Royal Shakespeare Company playing the leading roles of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice , Achilles in Troilus and Cressida , Bolingbroke in Richard II and Iago in Othello . His performances on television have been as varied as Freud , and as Blott in Tom Sharpe 's Blott on the Landscape . He won the BBC best radio actor award in 1979 for the Kreutzer Sonata . His films include Song for Europe , Greystoke and The Little Drummer Girl . A. R . Did you always want to be an actor ? D. S. No . Originally I wanted to be a doctor like my father , but it was soon clear I did n't have the intelligence for that -- that 's to say I was n't any good at mathematics and physics and that sort of thing . A. R . No actor seems to be . I wonder why ? D. S. Stanislavsky says it 's the multiplication table syndrome . He gives an example about lifting a heavy weight and doing a multiplication sum at the same time and says you ca n't do it . Well , I was one of the people who could n't do it even if I was n't lifting a heavy weight . A. R . You did n't do that exercise in drama school ? D. S. Not that I can remember . I went to drama school having done all the correct things that drama students are supposed to ignore -- like going to public school ( Wellington ) and dressing in conventional clothes . The teachers gave me a rough time for a couple of years because my student and acting image did n't fit . I still do n't feel it 's necessary to wear scruffy clothes to be an actor . A. R . Had any of these attitudes been generated by your first experience with the National Youth Theatre under Michael Croft ? D. S. Not at all . I can remember doing Bartholomew Fair at the Royal Court Theatre with the NYT and seeing all the scenery and lighting down on the stage at the end of the last performance and thinking how exciting it was to belong to the world of make-believe . A. R . And was that your reason for becoming an actor ? D. S. It was then . After that came my training at LAMDA and the realisation that make-believe or not , acting was hard work . And because , as I say , of my conventional background there seemed at the time a tendency to think of me as a reactionary young man . A. R . Did you think of yourself as a classical actor in those days ? D. S. Certainly not . In fact I found Shakespeare very difficult to get on with and was n't at all sure that I wanted to . So the first thing I did was to spend ten years with the Royal Shakespeare Company ! A. R . In which you played a lot of leading parts , as the days went by . D. S. That 's right . And I discovered the language and size of the plays in which I was working with all their complexities . You ca n't possibly hope to get that in your early days as a student . The real work of acting takes on a different dimension . It 's not a matter of theorising -- hard work never is . Acting can be both pleasure and torture -- but it is not fun and people are sometimes more concerned with the image of being an actor " at work " rather than just working . A. R . Can you say that your drama training has served you well ? D. S. One of the great things about drama school is what you learn to reject as much as what you actually learn . When I visit drama schools now -- and I firmly believe the professional actor is someone who should remain in touch with students -- it 's a matter of trying to help future actors to gain a clearer focus on the profession they are joining . There are so many things that matter . Health and stamina , plus a constant awareness of building the voice . Training is about trying to put the component parts together -- the physical and the mental , working towards an agility in both . A. R . What would you advise the new actor or the student to concentrate on in terms of auditioning ? D. S. My word of advice is this . Do n't worry about going out there to give the greatest performance of any particular speech and then come away depressed because you know you 've done it badly . I would say always remember that what is on show is oneself , not necessarily the ability to perform brilliant characterisations . The things to remember are the practical ones about yourself . " Next please . Mr Suchet ! " You go out there with trembling knees , and they are already noticing those trembling knees . The greatest acting role in an audition is to appear just to be yourself . A. R . Oscar Wilde said the most difficult pose was the natural one . D. S. Absolutely . And even more difficult in an audition situation where they are looking at your height , weight and how much stage you can fill by your very presence . Does he engage me ? That is probably the most important question the panel are asking themselves . And the next thing will be " what is his attitude to this audition -- is it positive ? " Always remember that they have asked to see you and that is what they want to do . So dress the part . Do n't go along in a dirty T shirt and floppy gym shoes or try to over-impress or be antagonistic . But just remember that you are being judged even before you speak a word . This is the first big lesson to learn . The next important lesson is to never apologise for being there . The number of auditions I have taken and staffed with the familiar question " what would you like to do ? " And the reaction has been one of slight stuttering , saying " Er , erm , ... well ... I 'm sorry but er ... well I 've got two pieces that er wo n't take long . The first speech is from Shakespeare and it 's taken from the Chorus in Henry ... Henry V and the second piece I 'd like to do is a contract if ... if , that is , we have time . " OK , by now you 've lost valuable time and probably irritated the entire panel by dithering instead of being sure of what you 're going to say , quite apart from getting on with the actual pieces you have learned . A. R Of course you can not teach confidence but you can teach a way of acquiring it . We always want to see and hear confident actors . D. S. Exactly that , although God knows confidence is difficult enough to hold on to . But you do have a right to be there and to be heard . Announce yourself clearly and think of what you intend to do . Take your time -- and do it . Linda Marlow Trained at Central School of Speech and Drama . On leaving she joined the Repertory Company at Worthing and played a great deal on the repertory circuit . Since those days she has done a great deal of work with Steven Berkoff -- particularly in his play for two people , Decadence which she has played in London , Los Angeles and Dublin . She co-founded , wrote and performed with a rock group in the early 70 's called " The Sadista Sisters " . In films She has recently completed a feature role in Mr Love for David Puttnam . A. R What do think is the most important thing for an actor to keep uppermost in mind when working in the profession ? L. M Gauging the kind of people you are going to meet in the way of giving you work . It is your personality and your personal care that is going to be noticed all the time . If you 're up for a " tart " part you must be prepared to present a flavour of the role as you see it . If it 's a general audition , be prepared for anything ; look good and concentrate like mad on your work -- always do that anyway . A. R Do you think actors need to keep in training once they have graduated from drama school ? L. M. I think most actors are conscious of the need to keep in training . It 's a very physically demanding business ; dancing is a wonderful way of keeping in training and also gives you a bigger scope in theatre these days . I think dancers can teach actors a lot and vice versa . A. R . Have you done any drama teaching yourself ? L. M. Yes . At the East 15 Drama School I have taken audition technique sessions , which was all fine and large but I encouraged them to write their own material as well as having stock pieces to do . Writing your own pieces can be very exciting -- if you have a talent for writing -- and can be more suitable to show off your personal talents . That and sight reading which is probably the most important thing of all . Auditioning makes me very nervous but sight reading -- maybe because I 'm better at it -- inspires me with more confidence . In filming you have a lot of this to do where you read a script through once and then have go . A. R In the theatre you 've worked a lot with Steven Berkoff and his own plays . Has this been something special in acting for you ? L. M. Yes . Very special . I know Steven 's method of working very well now . We did Decadence in London and America together -- and we 've made a film for Channel 4 television . There is Something very physical as well as verbally strong about Steven 's plays . But I think it 's always a case of what you bring to acting -- bring to the parts that are being offered to you . When I did Nurse Ratchett in One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest up in Manchester I read the novel and found a speech in the book that was really wonderful on the character and I asked the director if I could read it for him . I got the job and the speech became included in the play itself . I think you do have to do your homework as an actor . A. R . There are not the chances around these days as there were some years ago . Do you think actors now leaving training face greater difficulties ? L. M. Without doubt they do . When I got my first job out of training it was at Worthing in a juvenile leading role and I got my Equity card because I had been chosen . That does n't happen any more with young actors coming out of drama school . Twenty years ago it was expected that if you trained you would surely be accepted into the membership of your trade union and be given the chance to compete for the roles that were suitable . It was the last days of the old tradition , I suppose and I 'm glad I was lucky enough to be part of them . Now there is no guarantee that a career actually exists and Equity are not making it all any easier for the new young actors to establish themselves . And with the theatre running into difficulties about subsidy it 's not getting any more hopeful . A. R . In fact the dream that we all had about Great Britain acknowledging it 's theatre and funding it properly has suffered a lot of setbacks since the " sixties " . L. M. Yes . I think the present Government has a lot to answer for . After all we knew that subsidy did n't exist to subsidise empty seats but rather the necessary and new ideas that were wanted at the time . That is what subsidy is really all about . A. R . So for new actors coming into the business of acting what do you advise as the best possible course of action ? L. M. To be ready to work at all times . Auditions are a painful necessity of life and not a fair judgement on your career but you have to go through them . It 's all experience and that 's what you have to have a lot of before getting your own way about anything . A. R . Or " you do n't go through an experience ; an experience goes through you " ? L. M. True -- like a dose of salts ! But as to advice -- well , do n't just sit around waiting for the telephone to ring . Actors must be prepared to create their own work . Anywhere -- on the fringe -- forming small companies and producing their own work . Letting people see them at work . " Nothing will come of nothing " , as King Lear said once upon a time . Anthony Sher Trained at Webber Douglas Academy . Born in South Africa . Repertory seasons at Liverpool Everyman Theatre , Nottingham playhouse , Edinburgh Lyceum . In London played in Teeth " n " Smiles and Cloud Nine at the Royal Court Theatre . John , Paul , George , Ringo and Bert , Goosepimples , Gone West ( National Theatre ) King Lear , Tartuffe , Mayday , Richard III and Red Noses with the Royal Shakespeare Company . Television includes The History Man and films Shadey . He is also author of the book Year of the King . A. R . How did you come to be an actor ? A. S . Well , I was always going to be an artist and it was always assumed that I would leave South Africa and go to somewhere like Italy and study at an art school . I 'm not sure how that ambition changed course in Cape Town . I was always terribly shy and I was sent to what were known as elocution lessons -- to get me out of myself . A. R . Did Shakespeare cross your path early on ? A. S . Well , not really . I remember the elocution teacher was very keen on the modern plays that were being published then -- and I know we worked on Pinter which actually led me to use the part of Mick in The Caretaker for my subsequent auditions in England for a place in drama school . But I had very little idea of anything at the time and I did n't do very much acting . A. R . When you came to London to audition finally was it your first visit here ? A. S . Yes , and my parents had booked the audition for the Central School and found me a bed-sit in Swiss Cottage and being completely naive it was assumed that this was where I would be going . Two days later in what was a completely strange country I found myself doing this audition piece and I can remember very clearly sitting in the antechamber afterwards and the registrar popping her head round the door and saying balefully to a group of us sitting there , " Sorry , none of you " . A. R . An immediate rejection . A. S . Absolutely shattering . In fact I refused to believe it and went back to check , feeling " they could n't mean me " . Luckily we were still in time to get into the RADA auditions , which I did and got a letter from them saying " not only are you rejected but we strongly advise you to think about another career " . So there I was -- a bit stranded , not knowing where to go next . I finally made it into Webber Douglas where I finally realised that this was where I belonged . It seemed to suit me and I seemed to suit it and I felt comfortable . A. R . Can you remember anything of that audition ? A. S . I can remember doing my Mick again from The Caretaker and for Shakespeare I did an outrageous choice of Cardinal Wolsey from Henry VIII , which I do n't think I shall ever be suited to playing . A. R . On reflection , what do you feel about drama training ? A. S . I think it 's terribly important for people to train . Acting is not a profession where you can simply stroll on -- although I know a lot of fine actors have done that . I learnt an enormous amount and felt then as I do now that there really is n't enough training . Particularly the physical side of the work -- where there is n't nearly enough . I think we are under-trained physically here , unlike the Continental or the American actor who are trained as acrobats of gymnasts . In England we concentrate on the voice . A. R . Playing Richard III combines both of these features for you in a way that makes your point . A. S . Yes , it does . Playing Richard is so bound up with physical attitude , and I think that as actors we are not well enough equipped to meet that kind of physical thinking in that kind of role . The Alexander technique would be invaluable if it were properly included in all drama training programmes . And I think you find it goes beyond drama school , in say a company like the RSC , where we have the top person in voice but do not have the equal in physical advice and guidance . A R. What you are saying is that everyone seems to miss the work of Litz Pisk [ a legendary movement teacher at Central School ] who had such movement sense . A S. I remember when I was working as a dogsbody in the 59 Theatre Company in Manchester a group of Central School students came to be the spirits in a production of The Tempest and these were Pisk trained and had , it seemed to me then , a marvellous range of body language . You do see this much more in foreign companies and I think if we in Britain could match the physical and the vocal more we would really be on top with our training resources . A. R . Are you saying that this combination of vocal and physical training stems from the demands of the classical play , like Richard III , or do you think a different approach is needed for the modern writer ? A S. No , I do n't think so . The big difference is the dimension of verse , obviously , and you have to live through that differently . Classical acting is really quite a recent thing for me so it 's a case of speaking the verse as naturally as possible but observing it " s rhythms and structure . A. R . How do you feel about young people wanting to become actors , these days ? A. S . When it comes to acting people will always say " Do n't -- you 're going to get hurt " , and of course you wo n't believe them . And you will get hurt . I think it 's a terribly cruel profession -- it 's always YOU that is being rejected , the meat market side of the business . It 's hurtful when you see good actors out of work and the way in which their confidence is corroded by the system . I think there should be a more stringent system of entry into the drama schools so that there is a higher standard of work achieved by the time they come to join the profession . Auditions are quite unreal -- I mean , how can anyone show what they are about by coming into a room and doing the opening speech of a play ? In playing a part you have a whole journey of rehearsals behind you . A. R . So how would you recommend that actors are cast ? A. S . In the profession I would much prefer to see work generated by the directors , and the casting directors taking more trouble to go round and see the actor at work , taking people on the basis of work they had already seen . Even the interview system is not an ideal one -- once again you 're having to sell yourself -- and if you 're a character actor like I am I can not show myself without being somebody else . One has very little to offer in an interview and one sits there feeling rather embarrassed . A. R . That sort of system is not so easy for actors looking for their first job but easier when you are well known . A. S . Well yes , but let me say that I gave up going to auditions well before I became well known through The History Man , on television . I gave up because I felt insulted . I think you have to stand by what you believe . I have been lucky , I suppose . One job has led to another but I do remember a particular film audition which I walked out of , much to the concern of everyone , my agent , and the casting director . I was thought to be getting above myself because I refused to sight read a scene . I offered tapes of myself . But it was useless . No , I do not believe in the audition system . A. R . Well , you 're obviously not asked to audition now . A. S . It is a privilege ; and one does n't forget that . Working with the on the work in hand . I must confess I find being a complete freelance is a strain and I love the family feeling of a company . Material missing from transcription at this point ; can not correct or quantify , as original not available and book out of print But some actors prefer the risks . They like to live dangerously . A. R . Rather than act dangerously . Would you say that you are building a reputation in eccentric roles ? necessarily eccentric -- that just sounds a gimmick . Finding a character that is true in every moment is quite another matter . Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray Met at drama school , married in 1939 , honeymooned in weekly rep in Aberdeen and have starred together in more West End productions than any living theatrical partnership . These include Candida and Heartbreak House by Shaw ; The Wild Duck by Ibsen ; Where Angels Fear to Tread , from E. M . Forster ; On Approval by Frederick Lonsdale and Bedroom Farce by Alan Ayckbourn ( for the National Theatre ) . Michael Denison 's best known film role was Algie in The Importance of Being Earnest and he appeared with Dulcie in My Brother Jonathan . Recently they have both played in a major revival of The School for Scandal and have toured the Near and Far East . Dulcie is the author of twenty-two works -- seventeen crime stories , two novels , two plays and a book on the conservation of butterflies . She and Michael have collaborated on a " young person 's guide to the theatre " and Michael has written two volumes of joint memoirs -- Overture and Beginners and Double Act . A. R . You both went into the theatre together from the same drama school ? M. D. That's-right -- the Webber Douglas Academy . We went into weekly rep in Aberdeen . D. G. At first it was only Michael that was going but on hearing that we were hoping to marry they decided to have me as well . A. R . And since then you 've worked a great deal together ? M. D. In sixty-four stage productions , so far -- starring in twenty-six of them in London . But first , for me everything was interrupted by six years of army service after which like so many others I had to start again . Fortunately for us both , Dulcie had become a star both in theatre and films . A. R . When did you start acting ? M. D. playing female parts at school -- until my voice broke . D. G. For me it was also at school playing Sir Andrew Aguecheek . So we both started by playing the opposite sex . But I think I got into drama professionally in the first place by accident . I was told there was an acting scholarship going and I was broke so I took an audition and by a marvellous chance , won the scholarship . A. R . Can you remember what you did ? D. G. Absolute total recall -- it was Portia 's famous " The quality of mercy is not strained " from The Merchant of Venice -- and mercy was what I was asking for , literally , at that moment . Anyway the moment I trod the stage I felt completely at home . I ca n't explain it more than that . A. R . What was the training about in those pre-war days ? M. D. Much as today , I would think . There was a lot of concentration on the voice and good diction . I came to the school with considerable amateur experience of Shakespeare with the Oxford University Dramatic Society and had even played in a real theatre in Oxford . So the school 's first job was to cut me down to normal proportions -- which they did . I think the persons who helped me most were the professional actors who were playing in the West End and came to us as teachers during the day . D. G. Ellen O " Malley , though she had long retired , was a wonderful teacher too . She was marvellous at getting people to let go of inhibitions I remember . She had played a lot of Shaw including Candida ; and created Ellie Dunn in Heartbreak House , named after her by Shaw . M. D. And perhaps even more to us as modern actors was Alison Legatt , then playing with No�l Coward and Gertrude Lawrence every evening . D. G. Yes , she was the first person who made me realise that acting was more than just speaking and doing . You had to understand and project what made your character tick . A. R . When you work now with young actors do you notice great differences in their approach to acting from your own ? M. D. Well , the majority have begun on TV rather than weekly rep -- resulting in a gain in " reality " and a loss in audibility . They have also had to face greatly increased competition both to get into drama school and into the profession . When I went to Webber Douglas they practically fell on any man as a rare species . I remember there was seventy-five girls to seven men at the time . A R. So getting a good part in the end of term productions was much more competitive for you , Dulcie ? D. G. Oh , much ; just like the profession itself in a way . I believe the ratio of men 's jobs to women 's is 8 to 1 . A. R . Would you say that most of your professional careers have been spent on the stage ? D. G. Yes . Perhaps the best decade was the sixties when we played a lot of Shaw , Wilde and Ibsen . These included Candida , Heartbreak House , The Wild Duck and An Ideal Husband in which we agreed to play the dreadful Chilterns . A. R . Why dreadful ? M. D. As you know , Wilde 's full names were Oscar Fingal O'Flaherty Wills Wilde . It was said of An Ideal Husband that the characters of Lord Goring , Lord Caversham and Mrs Chevely were the work of Oscar Wilde and Sir Robert and Lady Chiltern of Fingal O'Flaherty . A. R . Has the position of the director changed in theatre for you over the years ? M. D. I think it has changed . Directors are more autocratic and powerful than they were -- particularly in casting . More autocratic and more absentee than before . Sometimes they give you the feeling that they have done you a great favour by attending rehearsals and at the end of the rehearsal period it 's " Bye-bye loves , now you do your thing and I 'll go off and do another " . Directors should keep their finger on the pulse of a production throughout it 's run . A. R . Which leads to the usual problems associated with casting and auditioning . Do you think there 's a better means of selection , other than what seem generally to be regarded as a rather barbaric system ? M. D. Of course it 's barbaric . But what alternative is there if you are unknown to a potential employer ? It 's a kind of exam -- and it 's important to school yourself to be good at exams . A R. One of the biggest questions for young actors today is the problem of becoming members of Equity in order to work in the business for which they have trained . Michael , you have done a lot of work both with and for Equity , what do you feel about the present day students ' dilemma ? M. D. Well , it is a dilemma . I 've never entirely agreed with the policy of restricted entry , although one knows all the arguments why this has been necessary . I think we have to remember at all times that we belong to a profession in which there can not be qualifications . The individual 's employment involves a subjective judgement on the part of someone else . I would like to think that the problem of entry into Equity could be resolved in the future -- difficult as it is . Perhaps graduates of a number of drama schools might be given a provisional Equity card requiring a minimum number of engagements ( and/ or weeks ) to be worked within the two or three years of it 's validity , if the holder is to be accepted into full membership . A. R . Is it true that within the membership of Equity there is a fair proportion of deadwood ? M. D. Well , with a membership of 32,000 and an unemployment level of 70 % it follows that there are many members who get little or no work within the profession . It would be harsh , however , to stigmatise them as deadwood . A performer can only prove his talent by performing -- meanwhile by their subscriptions members play an important part in making Equity effective . A. R . Has the profession become too large ? D. G. There will always be more people wanting to act than there are jobs available . M. D. The acting profession has actually grown smaller since , say , 1900 . Provincial cities which had ten to twelve theatres now have one or two and probably there were double the number of actors at that time . Standards were variable , of course , and first the cinema and then television wiped out a lot of bad theatre as well as some good . A R. Do you think the training of young actors should be more orientated towards television ? D. M. It is the most important medium for getting known by the general public and affecting the attitude of employers but the theatre is still the best place for learning your trade . As Richard Attenborough once said to me , " If you have n't learnt to play to an audience that is present , how can you expect to play to one that is n't ? " <text id="bnc:8">States , Religions , and Ruling Ideas Catholic Nationalists and Protestant Loyalists Today STATES AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS The chief purpose of the chapter is to outline how the two opposing groups in Ireland developed their dominant beliefs in the context of the new states of Ireland , and moulded the states to support them , strengthening antagonisms between the two groups . What changed with the partition of Ireland in 1920 was that the two dominant alliances were internally reorganized . In particular the protestant bloc lost the Southern protestant landowning gentry . The two alliances were ascribed territories in which to produce their social structures , political institutions , coercive bodies , informal and interpersonal networks of maintaining influence , and more clearly defined hegemonic cultures . The two societies gave expression to their own dominant interests as far as possible unhindered by each other 's interference . The process was assisted in the North by the self-exclusion of Britain from internal Ulster affairs by setting up the Stormont parliament which survived from 1922 to 1972 . Protestant -- loyalist domination , successor to the ascendancy , was circumscribed to one corner of Ireland while the catholic -- nationalist alliance asserted total domination in the remainder . The Catholic -- Nationalist State The direct consequences of this dramatic political change differed in each state , but paralleled each other , consolidating each alliance 's power . The Southern state became more catholic and nationalist in character . Its protestant groups declined in numbers , wealth , power , and cultural importance ( K. Bowen 1983 ; Walsh 1970 ) . The Northern state became wholly dominated by protestant loyalists and became extremely coercive in its dealings with the substantial catholic -- nationalist remnant within its borders . It was the failure to incorporate the catholic -- nationalist remnant into the consensus of the Northern statelet which resulted in sporadic violence , institutionalized and structural on the one side and insurgent-guerilla on the other . The two alliances succeeded in creating sufficient structures of hegemony and coercion to maintain social control for a significant number of years . But Northern reliance on force , necessary if the character of the state was to be absolutely preserved , was the weakest point and the eventual undoing of the apparent stability achieved by the partition settlement . The Southern protestants have diminished greatly in numbers since 1911 , because of the loss of life in the 1914-18 war , some emigration , and probably mixed catholic -- protestant marriages ( Walsh 1970 ; White 1975 ; Ch . 7 , below ) . In 1911 , the protestant population in the South was 10 per cent . By 1925 it was down to 7 per cent and in 1971 it stood at around 4.1 per cent . Over the same period , the Church of Ireland experienced continuing rounds of church closures and became top-heavy in numbers of clergy . Statistics up to 1971 showed it as having an old-age structure and to have been in continuing decline , though there are recent signs of improvement ( Census of Ireland 1981 ) . Southern protestants do not appear to be particularly oppressed by the state ( White 1975 : 169 ) , but they would clearly change aspects of the constitution and legislation if they were in a position to do so . They have always retained a low political profile . They have also never been perceived by the state as a threat , perhaps because of the revolutionary pedigree of some of their �lite . As such , their own life-styles , societies , and schools have been relatively protected , but perhaps at the expense of political action . A practical ideology for a catholic Ireland was worked out and the aim of a society uncontaminated by the outside world was pursued . Both church and state functioned symbiotically . For his part , de Valera , prime minister for most of the period from 1932 to 1959 , pursued isolationist policies , economically , politically , and culturally , seeking at once self-sufficiency , neutrality , the restoration in part of Gaelic culture through the minimal enforcement of the Irish language , and the control of media consumption . In concrete terms , de Valera was acting on behalf of the established economic interests of rural Ireland , in particular the small landowners and small businessmen . The commitment to the eradication of rural and urban poverty , while not entirely forgotten , was subordinated to the goal of economic independence from Britain . The path pursued particularly matched the clergy 's vision of the profanity of towns and sacrality of rural life . This was despite the fact that the reform of Irish catholicism in the nineteenth century sprang mainly from urban areas . One must also remember that the bulk of the clergy both in Ireland and in the remainder of catholic Europe came from rural backgrounds , where the sense of God is , or was , part of the air one breathes ( Acquaviva 1979 ) . From de Valera 's point of view -- and the majority of the nation and its politicians would have concurred -- the fact that the Free State was over 90 per cent catholic meant that its moral and social outlook would reflect catholic beliefs . This was seen to be the democratic process at work . The results of isolationism in terms of human suffering were massive emigration ( some 20,000 every year to Britain up to the 1960s ) , and industrial and commercial underdevelopment until the late 1950s . But there were undoubted benefits to both church and state in this set of policies , for they were to the mutual advantage of nationalism and catholicism as these were perceived by their respective institutional representatives , namely the politicians and the hierarchy . They were the result of catholic -- nationalist success in establishing a separate state , so separate that the protestant tradition as a political force had been excised from the thinking of the entire catholic grouping in the South , from church to state to popular consciousness . This occurred despite the continuity of the catholic hierarchy in Northern Ireland and despite the war experience of those catholics who had been involved in the army . Armistice Day is still only celebrated in Southern Ireland by protestants : as late as the early 1970s , you could still tell a protestant by his poppy on 11 November . The commemoration of the dead in the First World War was seen as a triumphalist commemoration of those who died for Britain . The very existence of the catholic state in all but name , the realization , if only in part , of the territory of Ireland as both catholic and nationalist , had a significant and continuing impact on both the clergy 's practical theology and the laity 's day-to-day perceptions of social reality . Similarly , the de facto existence of the protestant enclave in the North and its pursuit of protestant dominance in that state may have even reinforced a similar , though integralist , approach in the South . With independence the Irish Free State developed a type of political party organization on modern lines , but without the genuinely class-based politics one finds in other European countries . The party structure followed was based on the Irish civil war antagonism of 1922-3 , with the pro-Treaty party more or less in power until the anti-Treaty party entered politics in 1930 . However , both sides developed a centralized party organization , with politicians following the party line . The Protestant -- Loyalist State The condition of the Northern catholic -- nationalist minority has been very different from that of the majority in the South . The Northern minority has been feared throughout the period by protestant loyalists for two main reasons . On the one hand , force has been required to subordinate it , and , on the other , it has always threatened to outbreed protestant loyalists , an outcome which has only been avoided by catholic -- nationalist migration over the past seventy years . The loss of numerical superiority by protestants would result in the collapse of their statelet . Disappearance of their dominance would lead to a unified Ireland or else the restructuring of a new statelet with smaller geographical boundaries in which their dominance was again reassured . In any case , repartition is not out of the question . Recent work on the religious demography of Northern Ireland by Compton and Power ( Compton 1985 ; Compton and Power 1986 ; Ford 1986 ; Commins in Clancy , et al . 1986 ) indicates a separating out of protestant and catholic , with the catholic population drifting westwards and vice versa . The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland . They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist parties , Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party , though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism . Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two parties , a substantial number of their voters do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist-type class structure in a new Ireland . The Workers ' Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border . The provisional movement is divided on the issue of capitalism but , for the time at least , has an openly declared policy of achieving an island-wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process . The SDLP , still the main party of catholic nationalists in Ulster , has dropped much of its socialist platform and maintains a delicate balance between nationalism and pragmatism in its politics . Despite frequently heard voices to the contrary , total catholic -- nationalist domination would be the likely outcome of a united Ireland unless a confederal structure were implemented . This is partly because of the structure of catholic nationalism in the Southern state and partly because the national unity sought by significant numbers of Northern catholic nationalists is still on the basis of the reversal of protestant -- loyalist hegemony rather than a power compromise . Solidarity with Southern nationalists is still a major Northern nationalist perception , despite the fact that they view their Southern compatriots at best with indifference and at worst as traitors who sold them out to the loyalists . McGreil ( 1977 : 363-408 ) has shown that though Dubliners find the English more acceptable than the Northern Irish , Dubliners still seek a solution to the Northern problem within an all-Ireland state . Also , there can be no doubt that the South would intervene in the North on behalf of the catholic -- nationalist minority if Britain withdrew and civil war broke out . Equally , Southern catholic nationalists prefer a unified Irish state , though a majority of 54 per cent would accept a federal one based on the present two state units . One can therefore conclude that there is a sense of unity throughout the catholic -- nationalist population as a whole , though one in which certain groups , namely farming interests and the church , at both clerical and popular levels , have strategically dominated , at least until recently . By 1914 , the protestant -- loyalist group was well established and ready for war against catholic nationalists should it have proven necessary . Issues of class conflict within the group were to remain largely subordinate , as the matter of the nature and defence of loyalism itself was to dominate the scene right down to the present day . There was to be an expression of a certain solidarity between members of both the catholic and protestant working classes in the Belfast demonstration of 1932 against the inadequate poor relief during the period of particularly high unemployment . But such cooperation was rare and quickly taken over by sectarian issues . Protestant -- loyalist and catholic -- nationalist politics in the Northern statelet differed from those in the South . McAllister ( 1980 ) describes that political culture as traditionalist , and dominated by clientelism , parochialism , local attachment , and ascription : politicians were elected on the basis of local reputation and solely with reference to local issues . During the period of the Stormont parliament , half the seats were uncontested . This was frequently true of Westminster elections too . It would seem that the special state character of Northern Ireland , with its very legitimacy always under threat , has been the main reason for the maintenance of this pattern of politics . Up to the late 1960s , catholic nationalists were split between two main political groupings . There was the Nationalist Party , a weak organization for which local priests had to provide some kind of legitimation . As a party , it really only exercised a modicum of power in relation to the Stormont administration . Then there were the republican parties who focused their attention on Westminster elections . The disorganized nature of catholic -- nationalist politics was only turned round with the emergence of the civil rights movement of 1968 and the subsequent forming of the SDLP in 1970 . However , during the 1970s , the socialist element was weakened with the departure of labour leaders . The remaining leadership represented a modified nationalism in which new middle-class moderates held the upper hand . The party as a whole tended to represent the employed and the over-thirties . The unemployed and the under-thirties have lately tended to support Sinn Fein since its adoption of an electoral strategy in the 1980s ( Bew and Patterson 1985 ; O'Dowd , Rolston , and Tomlinson 1980 ; Moxon-Browne and Irvine 1989 ) . The Unionist Party became the central political organization of the protestant -- loyalist alliance . True , there was some fragmentation of members on class issues . The occasional independent unionist and independent Orange-lodge representative in politics were a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 . The Northern Ireland Labour Party also was the principal organization representing protestant trade unionists . But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization , much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists , which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united , independent Ireland . It was only with " the Troubles " , from 1968 , that unionists broke ranks . Yet , despite the splintering , they have succeeded in allying the present two main parties against the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 . The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland , formed at the time of the abolition of the Stormont parliament , represents those catholics , protestants , and others who disavow the twin alliance of Ireland but retain at least a practical attitude on sovereignty . They prefer British to Irish rule and seem unlikely to move from that position . While the party contains many who actively seek peace and reconciliation , it would be wrong to think of them in any sense as overcoming the basic conflictual components of bloc power in Ireland . " Castle catholics " , those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union , have also voted alliance , but are probably now , in 1989 , switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations , which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster . The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital interests , particularly as represented by the conservative party . But that is what the arrangement was : an alliance rather than a consolidated interest or a genuinely shared culture . Protestant loyalists dominated the statelet from its formation . The British government only obtained certain concessions from the Stormont government in implementing measures of the welfare state variety after 1944 . In a detailed study of the Stormont archives , Bew , Gibbon , and Patterson ( 1979 ) have shown that there were indeed different currents within the Stormont administration but the ones which predominated belonged to those among the ruling protestant classes who were bent on preservation of the status quo for their own purposes , including their own dominance of the protestant alliance as well as their particular sectional interests . The range of tactics used to keep catholic nationalists subordinate was quite comprehensive . At the political level , proportional representation was abolished for local elections in 1922 and for Stormont elections in 1929 . This minimizing of catholic -- nationalist representation was aided by the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries for local government elections , which concentrated the catholic -- nationalist vote in a smaller number of constituencies . At the level of law and order , total control of the subject population was achieved in two ways . Firstly , the Ulster Special Constabulary , invented to supplement the main police force , was derived largely from the former Ulster Volunteer Force . Divided up into three groupings , the A , B , and C special constabularies , according to diminishing power , responsibility , and time commitment , the force was soon cut down to class B only and these came to be known as the " B Specials " , a thoroughly armed , militant , semi-private , and sectarian army . It could be called upon at any time and indeed was from time to time . Secondly , through the enactment of a special powers Act in 1922 Stormont gave itself and its police force the powers of detention without trial . These were used copiously over the years of Stormont rule . Catholic nationalists could be and were arrested with little suspicion , detained , frequently beaten , and all with little or no possibility of redress . The British government over the water could have been a million miles away ( for detailed accounts see Arthur 1984 ; Buckland 1979 ; Farrell 1976 ; for a summary see McAllister 1983 ; for a summary of all forms of discrimination adopted , see Whyte 1983 ; Hillyard 1983 ) . But the British government was still involved in the reproduction of antagonisms in the Ulster statelet , rather than passively accepting the perpetuation of inequalities and discrimination against the catholic -- nationalist minority . O'Dowd , Rolston , and Tomlinson ( 1980 ) point out that when the centralized state comes in simply to administer and maintain law and order , it tends to reproduce relationships which pre-exist its intervention . When the British state began its policies of social interventionism from 1945 , it succeeded in fragmenting the local power base of unionism by centralizing the sources of welfare and making them at least in part available across the sectarian divide . There was thus some impact on discrimination . However , when Stormont was abolished in 1972 and central government took over entirely the responsibility for local administration , it adopted the technocratic , non-policy making approach to its new role . Part of the reasoning behind the move was the search for an effective policy to contain the violence within Ireland and prevent it from spreading to Britain . It was also hoped that bureaucratic impartiality would reduce discrimination further . But the technocratic approach did not lessen discrimination but reproduced it in a subtler form . The continuation of inequality is still clear in the fields of income , housing , wealth , and employment but most of all in the protestant -- loyalist alliance 's embargo on the minority ever holding political office . At least up to 1985 , the British government submitted to the threat of violence from the loyalist community and accepted the protestant -- loyalist veto on any change in the constitutional structure of their state . With the Anglo-Irish Agreement at Hillsborough in 1985 , it has sought to lay aside that veto , and establish in principle its political right to modify the structure of power and control in Ulster by involving the Republic of Ireland in a common policy on security . However , in the interests of Western European stability and its own financial position , the British government is perhaps still putting off the final offer -- either British withdrawal or some form of power-sharing with catholic nationalists -- in the hope of loyalists coming round to what is seen as a more reasonable position . The class structure of Northern Ireland is predictably dominated by protestants . Of course , with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational companies , additional sources of power have been brought into play . But it is likely that the professionals who have been responsible for the running of such companies at local level will have been allied to the more liberal group among the upper protestant classes , as represented by such families as the O'Neills , who have looked to the English public schools for the right sort of education . Wallis , Bruce , and Taylor ( 1986 ) list this mainly landed gentry among the cosmopolitans of Ulster society . Also cosmopolitan in outlook are a variety of traditional professions , particularly university lecturers . Many of these moved their allegiance to Ulster 's alliance party on its foundation in the mid-1970s . The limitations on the power of these liberal groups within protestant loyalism are demonstrated by the fact that they have only been allowed to function among the leadership of the people so long as they obeyed the basic tenets and values common to the alliance as a whole . This is shown in the protestant -- loyalist rejection of Terence O'Neill and O'Neillism , and of his successors , Major Chichester-Clark and Brian Faulkner , as prime ministers of Northern Ireland ( 1968-74 ) . As Eversley ( 1989 ) has recently shown , while only 2 per cent of Roman catholics hold managerial and professional positions compared with 4 per cent of protestants , they are over-represented in the bottom third of the Northern class structure , but generally within the framework of a traditional dual protestant -- catholic labour market . Those members of the catholic population who sought to advance up the class structure had to adjust to more marginal roles among the professional classes . Those becoming solicitors , barristers , university lecturers , and doctors had to accept limitations on their careers if they stayed in Ulster . Catholic civil servants usually had to abandon any practical political project if they wished to proceed through the ranks . Even so , those who had any career success were extremely few in number . In terms of the acceptance of law and order , the bulk of the catholic -- nationalist remnant form a part of the civil society of Northern Ireland , though as much as a third of the remnant can defect from this consensus , as when supporting the Provisionals over the " H " -Block prison issue . But in terms of the protestant -- loyalist philosophy , the overwhelming majority of catholics oppose the state 's legitimacy . This does not mean that there is no cultural convergence at all between the two alliances in Ireland . Apart from basic agreements on the necessity for law and order for survival purposes , an issue which will be treated later in the chapter , there are a number of similarities which should be mentioned . Both sides are based on capitalist activity and both governments have followed modernization rather than self-development strategies since the 1960s More particularly , despite some continuing differentiation in industrial specialisms , such as the declining presence of heavy engineering in Ulster , the types of industrial activity are increasingly similar as are the economic and unemployment problems , population growth , and productivity , with the probability of higher deficits in the North ( FitzGerald 1972 : 63-85 ; New Ireland Forum 1983-4 : ii . 8-13 ; O'Dowd and Wickham in Clancy , et al . 1986 ) . Also , investment patterns in both parts of Ireland are increasingly similar , being a mixture of British , international , local , and cross-border companies . Internal commerce , from heavy machinery to domestic goods , largely ignores the border , and the high street banks are the same throughout Ireland . The main economic differences reflect the different structures of the state and the different state policies adopted by the British and Irish governments at any one time , though with a significantly higher state sector of employment in Ulster . There is likewise considerable overlap in cultural areas . There are strong similarities in inter-family and inter-gender relations . There is a recognizably similar personal style to all face-to-face interaction throughout Ireland ( for the North , see Harris 1972 ; Easthope 1976 ) . There are similar strengths to kinship networks . Catholic and protestant church organization straddles the border . There are certain common features in ethical attitudes : puritanical attitudes in sexual matters , conservatism , friendliness , " down-to-earthness " , sense of duty to neighbours , critical attitudes to officialdom , and similar judgements as to what constitutes good and bad conduct ( Harris 1972 ; Leyton 1966 ; 1975 ; Buckley 1984 ) . Public events sometimes confirm these viewpoints , as has appeared in the continuing joint catholic -- protestant political opposition to the abolition of the criminalization of homosexuality . However , the existence of a certain level of common values is no indication by itself of a ground for peace . It may even be possible to obtain approval from opposing groups for a set of moral maxims such as peace , justice , and freedom -- see the lists of values in McKernan 's ( 1980 ) research , for which he found a high level of acceptance among both Northern Ireland communities . But when it comes down to concrete moral judgements and commitments , such abstractions will be found interpreted in opposing ways . Religion The Roman catholic church retained a unified hierarchical organization for the whole of the island with its bishops meeting periodically at Maynooth . In 1927 , 1929 , 1956 , and 1960 , there were plenary synods and councils . Since then , the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year , but usually in secret sessions . In the North , the bishops pursued the Irish catholic community 's interests in what could only be called a spirit of " pillarization " . This is the arrangement in Holland whereby various institutions such as media , schools , cultural organizations , welfare services , and hospitals are duplicated , and run by the separate catholic and protestant communities . In Holland there is even a third or state sector . In Ulster a full panoply of institutions emerged from the dual pressure of the church 's concern for its people , and the Northern state 's discrimination against catholics . The clerical and lay leadership also experienced a third pressure , that of protecting the faithful from the proselytizing activities of a number of evangelical protestants mainly among the young . The church obtained a separate school system , funded mainly by the Northern Ireland government , similar to the system of catholic schools in Britain . It also set up its own scouting organizations , clubs both sporting and social , with Irish music , Irish dancing , and Irish or Gaelic games . These games were and still are much loathed by the majority within the Northern protestant community . Priests continued to act as sponsors of the local catholic -- nationalist political structure , chairing meetings of the party and permitting the political use of the parish hall . The parish structure and school became the heart of the Northern catholic -- nationalist community , rendering culture , politics , and religious identity as interchangeable for members of the in-group . Employment patterns , which followed the routes of enforced segregation in favour of protestants -- for they controlled the greater part of the job market and especially the major industrial enterprises and the entire government sector of civil servants and police -- were even reinforced by the system of job references provided by the parish priests and catholic notables . The church certainly had to follow this path in the face of the external constraints ; but the practice did strengthen its status , power , and the structure of political divisions . In the South , the church hierarchy pursued the path of full cultural control . Conditioned by church canon law , participation by clerics in politics was forbidden . But at the same time , an enormous sense of responsibility to protect the church , the family , and the minds and hearts of the faithful from incursions by the state was perceived to be the basic duty of the church leaders . The leadership of the state knew in large measure what was wanted : it was part of the national -- popular consciousness as well as being itself a result of the convention between church and Irish parliamentary party in the previous century . What had been convention became part of the natural , common-sense universe of catholic -- nationalist ideology . No real consultation would have been necessary on that score . As will be seen in the next chapter , when the republican wing under de Valera took over as the Fianna F�il party in the 1930s , constitutional law was restructured , according to both a reformed republican ideology and current Roman social teaching , and in those areas where the high clergy thought it necessary . In addition the church promoted strong centralized relationships between itself and government and actively discouraged the spread of power to the periphery or local level . Within the ranks of the clergy and religious orders themselves , there was a far from complete , centralized structure , but rather a dual one . Apart from small orders , usually of nuns , set up by local bishops for local needs , religious orders have always had considerable independence from the bishops . Part of this independence must be attributed to their ownership of houses and schools , paid for directly by their benefactors , payers of school fees , or investment funds . This has sometimes led to disputes between religious and secular clergy , between orders and bishops . For example , in the Northern context , the previous bishop of Down and Connor , Dr Philbin , refused for most of his period of leadership in Belfast to have Jesuits visiting or residing in his diocese . Not that the prohibition always succeeded . It began to be violated in the late 1960s by Fr . Michael Hurley who on one occasion addressed the presbyterian general assembly in Belfast against both the bishop 's private wishes and Ian Paisley 's open and defiant demonstrations . The dual division of ecclesiastical power has also been important because the religious orders have often been the vehicle for innovative theologies differing from the Roman line . Because such religious orders are themselves controlled from Rome , Roman discipline is conveyed via a route other than by the bishops . Even so , some orders still remain slightly independent from Rome , particularly the religious orders of solemn vows , whose existence preceded the reformation . Their numbers include the Augustinians and Dominicans , both of whom have been influential in Ireland and have produced theologians of liberal or left persuasion . Despite their dependency on Rome , the jesuits too have been important innovators on the contemporary scene in Ireland , particularly in the areas of education for ecumenism and industrial relations . Nevertheless the predominant catholic power lies with the hierarchy and secular clergy . Thus , while it is possible to identify liberal catholicism in Ireland from the late nineteenth century to the present , and though there has grown up a climate of liberal dissent and criticism of conservative catholicism , it is still possible to assert the prominence of conservative catholicism , particularly in its alliance with nationalism . The predominant political religious form was and remains , with some modifications and with increasing opposition , a centralizing and conservative catholicism . The protestant churches in Ireland also retained their island-wide organization after the political partition of the island . The church of Ireland still has one all-island synod , the presbyterians a single general assembly , the methodists one conference . Even Ian Paisley 's free presbyterians , who have communities in County Cavan and Dublin , are centrally organized , though this may reflect the practical situation in Ireland and the role of the " big man " himself within the church he founded . The annual meetings of the churches ' central bodies are a forum for religious political debate and have been known to express tensions between the values of the majority Northern and minority Southern protestants . In the Northern statelet , the power of the main protestant churches at present remains subordinate to that of the fundamentalists and the religious political societies . The societies of the Apprentice Boys , the Black Preceptory , and the Orange order , in conjunction with protestant paramilitary groups , could still form the basis for protestant political power if Britain withdrew from Ulster . From its domination by the old ascendancy , the Orange order in particular came to embrace protestants from all classes and churches . In fact , in rural areas today , the Orange hall has frequently been the only place where protestants of all shades have met to renew their belief and commitment to Ulster protestant loyalism ( Harris 1972 : 162-5 ) . It is important to note that these organizations are internally stratified . Those nearer the top , particularly in the Black Preceptory , the inner sanctum of the society structure , are there because of their moral and religious standing in the local community : wealthy farmers , businessmen , good churchmen , or at least of known moral probity . They tend to represent the " religious " as opposed to the " rough " end of the protestant spiritual spectrum . Fundamentalist religious groups have increased their power in Ulster in recent decades , especially the free presbyterians . Their small church membership of around 10,000 hides the wider appeal Paisleyite politics has for the small businessmen and farmers of protestant Ulster . The setting up of a new form of Ulster Club organization involving paramilitary activity in the wake of the Anglo-Irish accord of 1985 , is an added dimension to the struggle for power within the alliance . It is likely that the inner core of local church laity , such as select vestry members of the Church of Ireland and presbyterian elders , provided and still provide one of the links between the material and spiritual interests of the groups in the alliance , as these laity were and are active in the business and commercial fields also . THE DOMINANT BELIEFS OF THE TWO ALLIANCES As we examine the dominant beliefs of the two alliances , it must be stressed that we are not looking at beliefs possessed by each and every person who identifies to a greater or lesser extent with either set of traditions . Rather we are looking at those beliefs , supported by significant power bases within each bloc , which have won out in the political process in the past seventy years and still appear to be doing so , in some cases with much decreased vitality . The dominant beliefs of the catholic -- nationalist bloc still are that the group forms a people who are Gaelic-Irish , constitute a nation , are republican , and populate an island which has a natural , inner political unity . We reiterate : the dominant beliefs of the alliances which we have termed historical blocs are not necessarily shared by all but are promoted successfully by dominant groups and have some grounding in the consciousness of the wider membership . Thus , Irish nationalism is conceived by most members in an abstract way , but it has concrete import for key groups . Equally , a particular type of catholic identity may not belong to all but remains politically dominant for similar reasons . The outcome of the dominance of both is that historically there have been critical mediations between religion and politics for catholic nationalists . As will be seen in the remaining chapters , a particular form of Irish catholicism known as monopoly catholicism has assisted in the concrete success of the mix of the beliefs with economic beliefs in capitalism , ownership of land , and inheritance , helping to bring the elements to an explicit formulation in the 1937 Irish constitution , which has ever since shown considerable resistance to reformulation . The prevailing protestant -- loyalist beliefs stress the existence of the people of Northern Ireland , who are distinguished by their Ulster protestantism and democratic values , and by their claim to a flexible territory of Ulster . Despite some socialist groups within the alliance , the dominant economic belief is capitalist . A further central belief has recently begun to appear as equivocal , namely loyalism itself . Related to this is the final principal belief element , the conviction of the legitimacy of force in maintaining the subordination of catholic nationalists within the statelet . A fuller account of these two groups of dominant beliefs benefits from some comparison between the two . " We , the People ... " The only way catholic nationalists can fulfil their present aspirations as a people is by extending the Republic of Ireland to the entire island . This would mean containing within their state one million persons to whom such a national identity would be totally antithetical . The Irish people are defined primarily by their allegiance to the present restricted or future enlarged republic , but it is popularly understood that they will normally have the further characteristics of Gaelic Irishness . The belief is still popular that such a race exists , rather than there merely being a cultural group based on nationalist , republican , and catholic religious sentiment . It is a belief which has intellectual credence in Ireland ( O'Tuathaig 1986 and M. M. Ireland 's responding letter , Irish Times , 8 Dec. 1986 ) . Theoretically , one would expect the Northern catholic community and the six counties of Ulster to be considered a lost remnant , unredeemed from British rule , and indeed this is by far the most popular interpretation . But , of course , the problems that arise out of this interpretation are twofold . Firstly , there is the problem of the protestant population itself in the North . Their position as Irish people is ambiguous . For the hard-line republican position , there is even a duality : protestant loyalists are taken as foreigners with an alien culture , and as either a pariah group -- the mere instrument of British imperialism -- or simply not there . Their culture has no rights , no claim to an alternative identity . Intellectually , the problem is the British presence in Ireland . But emotionally , the non-people are hated or at least detested . Clare O'Halloran ( 1986 ) has shown how the social reality of Northern Ireland remained a continuing blind spot for Southern Irish nationalists particularly from the founding of the state to 1949 . We aim to show in Chapter 5 that this blindness was in part promoted by the religious elements in their beliefs . Secondly , there is the problem of the Northern catholic community , which tends to be taken as a monolithic nationalist community . Apart from the fact that there has been significant support for the alliance party over the last dozen years or so among the catholic middle classes , there is also a further factor . Rose 's ( 1971 ) survey , conducted in 1968 on the verge of " the Troubles " , found that as many as 30 per cent of the catholic population were " explicitly prepared to endorse the constitution " of Northern Ireland , which then included the Stormont parliament . Catholics , however , did not vote for the Unionist Party . This indicates an acceptance of the state structures , or a recognition of a need for the separation of Northern Ireland from the remaining state structure of Ireland , but at the same time a continuing opposition to protestant -- loyalist dominance . One can also add that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question . Seamus Mallon , MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland , but some of his co-politicians in the party would not share that view . Perhaps one should note the care with which the present leader of the party , John Hume , chooses his words over the future of the North . He is careful not to promote the theme of reunification , but talks of discovering " a new way " , setting up structures of co-operation in the North between the two Northern Communities , with the support of the Southern government . However , the policy is seen as ambiguous . Those who wish , both unionists and nationalists , can interpret it as the beginnings of absorption into an all-Ireland state . But those who wish for a basically Northern solution , even a dual national state with inputs both from the Republic and Britain , can interpret the policy as suiting their needs , and can thus find space on the ballot paper for the SDLP . While in the last century there was still some attempt to embrace all people in Ireland as the Irish nation , now the nation subsists in the Irish catholic population . The ambiguity present in O'Connell has arguably aided catholic nationalists over the years in the justification of their policies . They have sometimes stressed religious elements why certain political changes were not possible , such as in legislation on public morality , schooling , marriage , divorce , and adoption . At other times , they have stressed the cultural , ethnic , historical , and geographical reasons why Ireland should be unified politically . At the same time , in theory they wish to accept that Ulster protestants form part of the Irish people while they actually do not accept them in practice . Indeed , until the ecumenical era of the 1960s , few catholics in Ireland were prepared to put before themselves some of the political religious issues which would have to be resolved if a united Ireland or accommodation to a separate political entity in Ulster were to become a possibility . The other alliance in Ireland , the protestant -- loyalist , does not thus far perceive itself as a nation . The view that they are one appears mainly in the writings of the British and Irish Communist Organization ( 1972 ; 1973 ) . However , there can be little doubt that significant numbers of protestant loyalists see themselves as a distinct , almost ethnic group . Clearly , they can be seen to have a particular self-concept , a sense of what Weber termed social honour ( Wallis , Bruce , and Taylor 1986 ) . A group which perpetuates itself by endogamous sexual reproduction usually has some perception of ethnic identity . It tends to have an active or passive belief , whether articulated or not , that it is either superior to , or rightfully distinct from , other similar groups . The theoretical or articulated ground for this awareness is a set of abstract beliefs and moral dicta particular to the group . One of these beliefs may be racial superiority , but does not have to be . The distinctive feature of the beliefs is that they assert or imply the honour or prestige due to the group over and against another or other groups , and consequently motivate the group to achieve such honour on the field of social conflict . Of course , such beliefs can be religious . It may be that in the protestant -- loyalist case this ethnic tendency may have priority over the British component of identity or be in conflict with it . The contradiction can be viewed in two ways . Either there are two different groups among the loyalists , subscribing to two different loyalisms . Or there is really only one group , but sharing a dual identity , with now one dominating their consciousness , now the other . The truth of the matter probably lies somewhere in between . As Miller argues , there is a long tradition among the protestants of Ulster of viewing the British state ambiguously . It is clear that in the past many of them have considered loyalty to be a two-way process , a contract or covenant , and that the state could be a traitorous party as well as the people . The tradition proved of crucial importance in forming the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until British recognition of their separate political claim in 1914 . If the tradition still exists today -- and it appears that it very much does so -- it implies that the United Kingdom does not have for many loyalists a natural character of statehood in the way the Southern state has for catholic nationalists . Covenant politics has come to the forefront again with the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 and shows the extent to which the populist politics of the Democratic Unionists is rooted in protestant -- loyalist tradition . This foundational belief gives meaning to the more popular belief in the right of the people to violence . Rather than such force being seen as a prerogative of the state , it is seen by many in the alliance to inhere in the people of Ulster who over and over again need to assert their autonomous rights . Increasingly it is seen as the only option left in the face of the continuing Anglo-Irish agreement . Continuing or worsening strife could solidify covenant beliefs into a separate Ulster identity absolutely dominant over the British component , and demanding its own independent state form . It is important to note that in 1912-14 the protestant -- loyalist group saw their right to violence as prior to that of the official state . It is also important to note that they saw the taking of law into their own hands as temporary , and pending the recognition by that state of its mistaken attitude towards them and their right to a degree of autonomy . It appears to be increasingly the case that there are two major traditions of identity perception among protestant loyalists . One tradition is the covenant one and is antagonistic to a straightforward nationalist sentiment . It is adhered to by increasing numbers who have become disillusioned with British identity and have seen Paisley 's words about the traitorous nature of British governments become reality as protestant -- loyalist domination in Ulster has been continuously eroded . These are probably more likely to vote for Paisley 's democratic unionism and to come from either religious , fundamentalist backgrounds or populist working-class and lower middle-class backgrounds . The other tradition remains British identity and still would seem to dominate the values of the official unionists . It is likely that a good many protestant loyalists oscillate between the two and still have to come to their moment of decision , one that is likely to be forced on them by future events . The Monopoly of the Majority The notion of the majority occurs frequently in Irish politics . In the South , protestant loyalists are accused of subverting the wishes of the majority in the island by not consenting to a united Ireland . In the North , protestant loyalists accuse catholic nationalists of not accepting the rights of the majority in the statelet to govern as it sees fit . In both cases , democracy is invoked . But it is the theory of democracy as the right of the majority to rule which is seen as central , rather than democracy as the preservation of minority rights . In the North , the belief comes via the British parliamentary tradition of the two-party system and its accompanying electoral process of " first pass the post " . For protestant loyalists , the majority means themselves . In addition , protestant -- loyalist politics has always been a zero-sum activity : one either has a monopoly of power or concedes it to the opposition . Because the opposition is the catholic nationalists , concession means the end of the statelet as such . The meaning of democracy shifts even further once it is interpreted within the terms of the Calvinist principle of the Godly society , where it is the lot of the just to assume power and to guide the citizens in the paths of righteousness . With this religious overtone in Northern Ireland , the belief in majority dominance has justified ignoring the rights of the catholic -- nationalist minority within the Ulster statelet . From 1985 , it has been continually invoked by Paisley and Peter Robinson in their attempt to subvert the Anglo-Irish accord . The Republican and Nationalist Components It is important to note that the political party system in the Republic of Ireland is largely based on the divisions in the national-popular consciousness which occurred at the time of the Irish civil war . To simplify a rather complex historical phenomenon , it can be said that the present political division between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael originates in positions taken by opponents in that war . The civil war was not fought over the partition of the island as is popularly believed . It resulted from one group , the republicans , not accepting the oath of allegiance to the royal sovereign of the United Kingdom , a requirement of the constitution of 1922 . Though the republicans lost the war , they eventually won their case with their successful introduction of the republican constitution of 1937 . This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place , furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism . Despite this development , the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued , the original republicans developing a populist , nationalist party , and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order , and moderation on the national question . But the fight did not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and " the historic integrity of the island of Ireland " , as nationalist parties described it in their New Ireland Forum ( 1983 -- 4 : i. 28 ) , from remaining basic to the perceptions of both parties . The Gaelic-Irish Component From the early years of the Southern state , cultural nationalism was deliberately developed by government means . There were deliberate attempts to develop elements of both high and popular culture in music , poetry , dance , and games . In particular , Gaelic games were promoted by the independent Gaelic Athletic Association . This association constitutionally still seeks to implement the organization of native pastimes and the promotion of athletic fitness as a means to create disciplined , self-reliant , national-minded manhood which takes conscious pride in its heritage of unrivalled pastimes and splendid cultural traditions as essential factors in the restoration of full and distinct nationhood . By this means , the association believes the cause of national unity will be furthered " until a complete nationhood is achieved " ( Gaelic Athletic Association Rule Book ( 1970 ) , quoted Hickey 1984 : 40 ) . Within this statement , which is rhetorical for some but deadly serious for others within the GAA , lies precisely the reason why the protestants of the North are so opposed to the development of Gaelic games and seek to oppose their extension if and when they can . The re-establishment of the Irish language as the first official language of the state became the national policy of the Irish government under de Valera and has only toned down in recent years . It was made a compulsory subject in the schools , an essential part of the Leaving Certificate , and it was necessary to pass an exam in the language to enter the civil service . A similar exam is still compulsory for anyone seeking to enter the teaching profession without the required Leaving Certificate pass , even if they are never to teach the subject . One immediately recognizes the active construction of the national ideal as promoted by principal currents in nineteenth century European nationalist thought ( see Kedourie 1985 ) . Another aspect of this form of cultural nationalism is that it was been strongly supported in the Irish national school system and Northern catholic school system by the clergy and religious orders . Not all the clergy and all the religious orders have been actively engaged in the pursuit of this ideal , but one or two orders have been ; for example , the Christian Brothers are devoted to the ideals of a Christian and catholic education , and supporters of the concept of a nation dedicated to God and at the same time distinctly Irish . In making this comment , one is merely pointing out particular ideological characteristics in hard-working , deeply religious , and committed people . However , in the practical context of an Ireland divided between two power blocs , such a nationalist form is profoundly ethnic and exclusivist , whatever its believed aims and ideal content . There is an elective affinity between this cultural vision and the religious vision of the Roman catholic church prior to the second Vatican Council , in its exclusivist attitude towards other Christian churches , an attitude which is far from overcome at the level of popular Roman catholicism . The Suppression of Class by the Dominant Beliefs In the South , the marginality of the third main political party , the Irish Labour Party , is an indication of just how successful the articulation of capitalism to religious and national beliefs is . The South is not a classless society , but its class nature has been well hidden in consciousness and dominated by the procedures of the capitalist-democratic process . Despite the principal duality of Irish party political power , the bourgeois structure of the state has rarely been questioned , only the degree of state intervention in the bourgeois economy . Also , the clerical church has been particularly antipathetic to socialism in any form . It showed itself to have a horror of socialism already in the nineteenth century . But its opposition also had a base in the property-owning , rural peasantry , and middle-classes , who had in the nineteenth century paid a heavy price for their liberation from oppression and whose status became rooted in their property , land , and livestock . Their attitudes were shared by their priest-sons , who in their turn were supported by Rome , whose solid opposition to socialism until the 1960s was very clear ( e. g. Pope Leo XIII , 1903 ) . From 1911 to 1914 , the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism . Rumpf and Hepburn ( 1977 ) view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s . The emergence of a new pro-capitalist party in the South from the end of 1985 , the Progressive Democratic Party , might show the extent to which political divisions based on the treaty and within the nationalist component of hegemony may have become problematic , to be partially replaced by an even more explicit concern with increasing the popular wealth and prosperity . Indeed , in the Irish general election of 1987 , progressive democrats took 14 seats , and 11.8 per cent of the total vote , which is sizeable for a young political party . The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North , however , does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic , that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance . The national question as such still remains a central preoccupation for catholic nationalists . Because the nation is seen as only partially liberated , and particularly by the membership of the largest party Fianna F�il , the animus of the national-popular consciousness is focused on this issue , to the detriment of class-based politics . There has , therefore , been little chance in the past for a political growth of class consciousness among subordinate groups . What socialism there has been among the catholic -- nationalist tradition has always tended to be allied to republicanism , especially in the period 1913 to 1930 ( Rumpf and Hepburn 1977 : 13 ) . The trade union movement was a case in point . The labour movement in Ireland was made up of two organizations . One of these was James Larkin 's Irish Transport and General Workers ' Union , the ITGWU . It came to have Connolly 's support and was on the way to becoming thoroughly nationalist and republican under Connolly 's influence . The other was the Irish Trades Union Congress . Before 1914 , it became the Irish TUC and Labour Party and was neutral to the Easter rising of 1916 . The ITGWU became a member of the ITUC in 1909 , but had very distinct and separate policies to the moderate ITUC which sought to keep its links with Northern protestant workers . Socialists tended to be republicans , though only some republicans were socialist . The republicanism of Irish socialist nationalists was of course logical in so far as they interpreted imperialism as an enemy of the indigenous population and as an expropriator of the people . But it was thereby alien to Ulster protestant socialists . A duality of class interests within republicanism has remained , with forms of bourgeois and rural peasant-owner republicanism existing side by side with socialist republicanism . This combination still exists in the provisional movement especially in the South despite the officially socialist policies of Sinn Fein , as well as in the Fianna F�il party . In parallel with the Republic , class politics has flourished even less on the protestant -- loyalist side , despite the periodic strength of protestant trade unionism ( Patterson 1980 ) . There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ; but it had been based on industrial workers , particularly in the shipyards , and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart . As Gibbon has noted , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain " the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles " ( 1975 : 3 ) . The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic -- nationalist and protestant -- loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions . By providing core beliefs , and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances , religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions , become embroiled in cementing alliances , and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole . The Religious Component of Catholic Nationalism There is nothing theoretically which hinders religion being an ingredient , or even predominating in the nationalist mix . Roman catholicism and protestantism constitute , in different ways and to varying degrees , nationalist and loyalist beliefs in Ireland . This is even official in the case of loyalism . In the case of Irish nationalism a specific relationship with catholicism has been formulated . Catholic identity is not essential for membership of the catholic -- nationalist group , but consent to the understanding that catholic values will predominate in the public sphere is essential , for these religious values are viewed to be eminently suitable , natural , and self-evidently of high moral quality , safeguarding the fabric of state and public morality . The link between Irish catholicism and Irish nationalism is deeply rooted . For centuries the Roman catholic church and faith were the bread of life to the subordinate classes in Ireland , deprived of their land , civil rights , and education . The church not only provided solace and comfort in those long years , but also a vigorous identity which enabled its people to hold up their heads amid the persecution and oppression . It provided intellectual and spiritual leadership and some alleviation from hunger and starvation . The clergy were the only source of education apart from the " hedge school " teachers ( Dowling 1968 ) and provided a significant moral and organizational resource . Several aspects of catholicism became particularly important in the nineteenth century . As has been seen , partially as a result of Cardinal Cullen 's nineteenth-century reforms , the church became more organized and developed in its numbers of clergy and religious . Its spiritual life underwent a considerable transformation . An important component of this religious renewal was its individualistic orientation ; it was the individual rather than the group or its activity in the world which was the subject of this religious activity . Like all the religious renewal of catholicism in the post-Tridentine period , it was predominantly pietistic . The importance of conversion to Christ and subsequent pursuit of the way of perfection was the centre . It was strongly influenced by the development and multiplication of the religious congregational system developed by Ignatius of Loyala , founder of the Jesuits and of the famous spiritual exercises or retreat system . The exercises were specifically directed to obtaining this effect . A main real difference in the experience which marked it off from fundamentalist and some pentecostal forms of conversion experience was that the outcome was not the assurance of being saved , but rather a spirituality of trust in Christ based on repentance and the conviction that God forgives repentant sinners . In this respect , it paralleled some forms of evangelicalism , particularly methodism . The trust implied fidelity or commitment , together with an abandoning of the old ways of sin and indifference for a total dedication to God 's will in Christ . But if this was the ideal placed before the clergy and members of religious orders , the reality for the people was generally somewhat different . There can be little doubt , however , that a sense of God 's presence and of the supernatural in general were long-standing characteristics of Irish popular religion , along with magical and semi-magical local religious practices . There can also be little doubt that the devotional revolution had a significant impact on the life of local catholic communities , especially as social life came to have a very strong relationship to the local parish and its priests . The transformations effected by the second Vatican Council of 1962-5 in liturgy , sacrament , scripture , and so on led to the accelerated decline of traditional rituals such as wakes and pilgrimages to local shrines . There has also been a significant decline in the cult of the saints , and many of the practices which characterized the devotional revolution of the mid-nineteenth century . This has been assisted by the continuing process of urbanization and delocalizing of religious experience . Local folk religion still continues in some forms . Its resistance is exemplified by the recent " moving statues " devotional upsurge of 1985 in South-West Ireland , where statues of Mary were believed to have changed their posture , wept , and bled ( Tobin 1985 ) . National centres of devotion remain relatively strong -- the shrine to Mary at Knock , the annual climbing of Croagh Patrick , pilgrimage and penance at Lough Derg . In fact , whereas the parallel protestant movement of evangelical revival was for all people , and the issue tended to be decisive , catholic spirituality diverged on both points . The principal one was that conversion and growth were particularly directed at the clerical-religious �lite , where the annual retreat system formed the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life . The retreat consisted , and still does , of anything from five to thirty days of spiritual exercises , usually in an atmosphere of silence and contemplation apart from listening to the preacher when there is one , but with additional features of both vocal and silent prayer . The laity had a pale reflection of this programme in the parish mission , designed to convert the laity or at least bring them back to regular church practices . Morality was for the laity , whose life was dominated by the battle against mortal sin , and who therefore lived under the threat of hell and were always at risk . Spirituality was the lot of the clergy and the religious , who were judged to have left this crude level of human religious existence behind , through conversion and a subsequent , progressive spiritual change . They were seen to succeed in living a sexually pure life as part of this . There was some extension of the pietistic ideal . Sodalities , such as the Legion of Mary , Opus Dei , and Christian Life communities , have partially extended this form of commitment to some , particularly more middle-class laity , and continue to have an important role in activating laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially . But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism . Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed , with clergy being left behind in some areas , the clerics remain the true cognoscenti in religious matters , and are expected to be so by the laity . This has always added to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life . The clergy were and still are in a special position , holding power over the laity because of it . This is one of the special characteristics of catholicism , and is found to a much lesser extent in non-episcopal traditions . Failure to conform to directives of priests and bishops were seen to break the very fabric of communion and to allow sin to enter in . This remains particularly so today where an objectivist stance on morality prevails in a national or local culture anywhere in the catholic world . From within this perspective bishops and clergy lay down rules for the laity to follow in any given situation and the teaching of the church is seen as absolutely clear and devoid of problematic . Rules are enforced rather than principles declared . In terms of the Irish catholic -- nationalist context today , pietism and authoritarianism have tended to structure the religion of the people to a significant extent , though the numbers subscribing to its world view appear to be declining . The clergy are seen as above criticism in their religious statements , and such criticism can cause considerable distress to many people . In his analysis of the popular culture which appeared among the promoters of the Pro-Life Campaign , set up to achieve a constitutional ban on abortion in the Republic in 1983 , O'Carroll pin-points certain characteristics , which can be abbreviated here : a monolithic and absolute view of the world , with its accompanying intolerance , derived in part from the direct consultation of clerics and politicians on public moral issues and the subsequent failure to develop an ethos of public debate ; a localized belief system , rooted in family and communal authority and issuing in a spirit of absolute conformity ; sexual prudery , a product partly of the inheritance problem ; and the development of acute anxiety when such beliefs -- inhering partly as they do in their practice and shaping of society -- are threatened . The absoluteness of the vision excludes all alternatives , and requires external validation . This can be provided by the magic power or words , such as inscribing prohibitions into the nation 's constitution , and by manifestations of the divine in terms of either retribution for failing to uphold the truth , or grace for upholding the truth , with rewards " such as oil finds and victories in the World Championships " . O'Carroll sees such positions exemplified by the protagonists ' refusal to accept that certain therapeutic abortions already permitted in Ireland were actually abortions and by their predictions of social chaos should they fail in their fight : " Hence phrases such as " the opening of the floodgates " , " the thin end of the wedge " , " the slippery slope " , " the permissive society " , and " the abortion mentality " " ( 1983 : 12 ) . It is important to point out that these expressions which interpret Irish social reality and events are also used by the high clergy . They are thus not simply a mentality derived from popular religion but from a traditional Roman catholicism which held sway in catholic Europe from the post-Reformation period and remained unchallenged until the 1960s . As will be seen in Chapter 5 , understanding this religious social consciousness requires some grasp of the traditional catholic teaching on the natural order and the good society , and how the nation is to respect the divine order established by God . An example of this can be taken from the recent contraception controversy in the Republic , which began in the 1960s . At that time , the Roman catholic archbishop of Dublin intervened in a pastoral letter in the following revealing terms : If they who are elected to legislate for our society should unfortunately decide to pass a disastrous measure of legislation that will allow the public promotion of contraception and an access hitherto unlawful to the means of contraception , they ought to know clearly the meaning of their action , when it is judged by the norms of objective morality and the certain consequences of such a law ... It may well come to pass that ... legislation could be enacted that will offend the objective moral law . Such a measure would be an insult to our Faith ; it would without question prove to be gravely damaging to morality , private and public ; it would be , and would remain , a curse upon our country . ( Abp . McQuaid of Dublin , letter to all the churches of the archdiocese , Mar . 1971 , quoted Wright 1973 : 224 ; italics added ) It is the specific effect this religious form has in Ireland which is under scrutiny . But the form as a whole should be recognized as inimical to protestants , especially when pursued in the arena of politics . This will be considered in the remaining chapters . The Protestant Element of Protestant -- Loyalist Beliefs The dominant religious element in protestant -- loyalist beliefs is a form of pan-protestantism . It has so far overcome at the political level the doctrinal and organizational divisions between protestants . It is based on the theme of protestant liberty , which is consciously contrasted with catholic authoritarianism . There are , however , many strands within this protestantism and they are frequently conflicting . One has to remember that well into the nineteenth century British identity was predicated first of all of the English . It also tended primarily to be Anglican and only secondarily reformed . Even when non-Anglican protestants had become accepted as citizens in England and Ireland towards the end of the eighteenth century as they already were in Scotland and Wales , English and Irish catholics remained politically suspect . They remained so throughout the nineteenth century and were not normally trusted with public office . Also , Irish catholics were represented in the dominant culture as an inferior race , ridiculed , and considered incompetent and beastly ( Curtis , Jr . 1968 ) . The idea of defending a protestant heritage is not solely an Ulster phenomenon but rooted in the British tradition . Whereas in Britain , with the growth of suffrage , catholics could never be perceived as a political threat because of the smallness of their numbers , in Ireland , with the growth of the home rule movement and its accompanying nationalism , they could only be perceived as politically , religiously , and nationally subversive and suspicion of them remained . The issues of freedom of conscience and freedom from Roman hegemony lie at the centre of Northern Ireland fundamentalism and are meshed in with its evangelical tenets . They are at their clearest in the teachings of the appropriately named free presbyterians : Liberty is the very essence of Bible protestantism . Tyranny is the very essence of popery . Where protestantism flourishes Liberty flames . Where Popery reigns Tyranny rules . As Liberty and Tyranny have no common meeting place , so protestantism and popery can not be reconciled ... popery is tyrannical in every sphere of life ... protestantism , at a stroke , cuts down all the shackles of superstition and priestcraft . The soul is free to commune with its Maker . There is one mediator between God and man -- the man Jesus Christ . Protestantism hands out an unemployment card to every Papist priest ... The protestant 's home is his castle . He brooks no interference from Pope , priest , pastor , preacher or prelate ... No one can control the protestant 's education or the books which he shall read . He is free born and trembles not at priestly threats or the papal curse ... At the ballot box the protestant exercises complete liberty ... ( Ian Paisley , Protestant Telegraph , editorial , 28 May 1966 , quoted Wright 1973 : 224 ) Despite this common , oppositional identity , protestants in Northern Ireland retained institutional , class , and doctrinal divisions . Presbyterians retained a consciousness of their Scottish origins and came to have a significant presence in the local economy and finance institutions , predominating in the North and East . Church of Ireland members , largely of English origin though less conscious of it , predominated in the south of Ulster and still constitute the majority among the protestant farming community . The small denominations and sects are province-wide , but are particularly strong in Belfast . They are more fundamentalist both in religion and in politics -- though some eschew political activity -- and are frequently more politically volatile . Both Church of Ireland and presbyterian political ethics in the North are supportive of the union and the forces of law and order , whereas the sects have a more flexible respect for state authority . One is not talking about a lack of breadth in theologies and points of view within presbyterianism and the Church of Ireland . Both have their liberals , religious intellectuals , and deeply committed ecumenists . There is a tradition of strong social consciousness in the Church of Ireland , evidenced by its building of hospitals , the support of some of its leadership for the locked-out Dublin workers in 1913 and their activities in other works of mercy without a proselytizing aim . A number of higher clergy in Ulster and many of its lay intellectuals stand a long way off from protestant -- loyalist politics and are in fact politically dissociated from them . In the South the church accepts the status of the independent republic and is loyal to it . But the bulk of its laity and Northern clergy , and probably more so its industrial and farming classes , are low church and evangelicals , the more protestant and anti-catholic end of the Anglican synthesis . One must also remember in this respect that a key feature of Church of Ireland organization is the local select vestry , which involves the laity in debate and discussion with clergy . When placed alongside the house of laity in the synod of the Church of Ireland , the power of the laity in church decision-making , including statements on political ethics and positions on public local issues , is quite considerable . A similar statement can be made of the presbyterian community , which is almost wholly Northern , and whose main Southern presbytery is in the counties of old Ulster which remain in the Republic -- Donegal , Cavan , and Monaghan . The organization of presbyterianism rests strongly upon the local community , with its division of authority between minister and elders . The elders are individuals of good-standing drawn from the local laity , who both appoint their minister and have considerable control over his or her activities -- there is at present one woman minister with a congregation in Northern Ireland . The sentiments among the majority of Northern lay presbyterians are biased towards those elements in the Westminster Confessional which are antagonistic to Roman catholic practice and belief : the evils of the papacy and priesthood and the suppression of Christian liberty , the evils of the mass and devotions to the saints , all of which combine to turn Christians to superstition and idolatry and away from almighty God and true salvation in Christ . An example of the strength of this animus occurred in 1982-3 in the celebrated case of the Revd David Armstrong , censured by the elders of his congregation for entering the Roman catholic church across the road to offer its worshippers Christmas greetings , and eventually forced to leave his ministry ( Armstrong and Saunders 1985 ) . Though the case is complex and the minister has joined the Anglican communion , the elements of the case at the time are quite significant . Ministers , both presbyterian and Church of Ireland , suffer similar pressures in many other local communities , except that they often stay silent rather than risk conflict , personal hardship , or violence . An added fear is losing church members to sects or the free presbyterians . Protestantism has a deeper significance in Ulster than it has had in Britain for over two hundred years . The very phrase " the Ulster people " refers to those who originally set up the true faith in Ireland and colonized the land accordingly . This religion of the people has some similarity to Calvin 's theology of the city of God on earth , though in a more modern and less rigorous setting than the one which Calvin tried to realize in his lifetime in the city of Geneva : Civil government is designed , as long as we live in this world , to cherish and support the external worship of God ; to preserve the pure doctrine of religion , to defend the constitutions of the church , to regulate our lives in a manner requisite for the society of man , to form our manners to civil justice , to promote our concord with each other , and to establish general peace and tranquillity ... ( Wright 1973 : 225 , quoting Calvin 1960 : 46 ) Calvin viewed his interpretation of the function of the state as the only Christian one . This mode of political religious action no longer starts out from a universal centre and figure , such as the papacy , but rather from the national or local church within the state , whose " magistrates " -- Calvin 's term for lay political leaders -- are ideally Christians of moral rectitude , who perform this duty as one ordained by God . Wright is correct to see Paisley 's interpretation of liberty as a development of this view . Both reject papal centralization and papal authority as a means for discerning just government . Wright is also correct to distinguish between a general interpretation of " salvation by grace " -- the teaching of the reformers -- and its fundamentalist variant , which he terms " salvation by grace through faith " . Perhaps " salvation by grace , experienced in listening to the preaching or reading of the biblical word , and in affirming the literal interpretation of that word " might be a better if clumsier phrase . In its effort to avoid all church mediation of the revealed word of God , the fundamentalist version relies on the literal interpretation of the Bible , but one which imposes a contemporary Western culture on to the different perceptions of a past culture . It is this characteristic which renders fundamentalist religion open to large numbers of fissures in communities , with preachers or sections of congregations shaking the dust from their feet and moving off to build or buy another church . Fundamentalism is radically anti -- catholic in its refusal to accept any form of priestly mediation . Hickey ( 1984 ) and Wright ( 1973 ) grasp the point that both fundamentalism and Calvinism have monopoly tendencies in the public sphere . The consequent interpretation of liberty is anti-libertarian and anti-pluralist . The implementation of liberty can stretch to keeping places of recreation closed on Sundays , upholding the rights of preachers to speak in public places even if it causes an affray , and opposing the development of catholic schools because their teachers do not communicate the Bible without priestly mediation . At the level of the unchurched popular consciousness , particularly in the urban protestant working classes , liberty may have slightly different significances . It may also mean freedom to purchase " Playboy " magazine , to indulge in the vulgarities of verbal and visual displays of the sexual and sexist types , though at a much lower level than those current in Scotland or England at soccer matches and in public houses . But there remains a strong respect for the religious leadership of the protestant -- loyalist bloc . There is a resonance of protestant beliefs in their unchurched experience , their rough , straight-from-the-shoulder speech , their interpretation of history and tradition , and solidarity at the economic level based on their dependency upon the leadership of the group as a whole for their work and welfare . The working classes are strongly bound into the total if ambiguous ideology of protestant loyalism . With the emergence of the statelet in 1922 , covenant politics was subordinated to the Stormont alliance only to re-emerge after Stormont 's collapse in 1972 . In 1971 , a new covenant was signed by over half a million men and women , committing protestants to a renewal of the covenant political ideal . Miller ( 1978 ) suggests that the contractarian element was no longer ever so solid . Be that as it may , it may turn out that the preparedness not to acquiesce in any all-Ireland solution is decidedly stronger than most commentators until recently were prepared to accept , except for the work of Bew , Gibbon , and Patterson . Thus , protestant loyalists fight incorporation into a united Ireland for the reason that their perception of protestantism and their values of polity contain a powerful rejection of catholic monopoly , which they identify with catholicism tout court . Their deeply held view on this matter is bound up with their interpretation of political realities . The South is seen as dominated by the Roman church . They point to the laws against divorce , abortion , and contraception , the power of the church in the education sector and past evidence of a hot-line between bishops and politicians as the proof of their contention . As will be seen in Chapter 5 , this interpretation is not without foundation . The ethnic identity or contractarian ideology of the Ulster loyalist is clear in its origins , motivated by powerful economic , ethical , and religious convictions , all of which are interrelated , mutually supporting , and validated by the existence of a dominating catholic -- nationalist bloc in the Republic of Ireland . The sense of solidarity has developed and hardened over the years . The popular slogan " This we will maintain " , that is the union with Britain , can be equally applied to the religious and moral values the loyalists pride so much and which they see as embodied in the protestant -- loyalist statelet , with its appropriate state apparatus of coercion and alternative paramilitary units . For this reason , they feel that the siege of Londonderry has never been lifted and they are prepared to die to defend that heritage . What the protestant loyalists in effect seek to maintain is protestant -- loyalist domination within a flexible territory , one which they feel justified in calling their land and ruling according to their conscience . The Key Mythical Structures of Protestant -- Loyalist Popular Religion It could be argued that the myths of Ulster protestantism and the institution of the Orange order take the place of the more centralized clerical organization of Roman catholicism in providing some element of overall religious unity among protestant loyalists . By myth is meant here what has generally come to be accepted within sociology and social anthropology since the work of Levi-Strauss : an account of the origins of a society or of particular crucial events in its life , which unite the cosmos to the social structure by actively shaping everyday life perceptions . The historical consciousness of Ulster protestants in this sphere is also a faith consciousness . The salvation history of the Bible is coupled with what is seen as a significant period in the history of the protestants of Ireland . The key event in the history of Ireland which appears to encapsulate Ulster protestant faith in God through Christ and the destiny of Ulster protestants as a people , is the war of 1689-91 . William of Orange is seen to have worked the decisive victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 . However , that myth is not quite the one which appears to have penetrated everyday life , perhaps because the place of the victory is located within the borders of the Southern state . The most powerful myth affecting everyday life narrates the less decisive defence of the city of Londonderry in 1689 . The protestant refugees , inhabitants , and garrison of the city , which was built deliberately with a wall lest a catholic rebellion should ever occur , held the city for fifteen weeks against a poorly equipped catholic Irish army led by James II , the exiled king . The besieged were led by a soldier and a clergyman . A further particularity stressed in the protestant -- loyalist account is the initiative and bravado of the local protestant apprentice boys who defied the city 's governor , Robert Lundy . He had ordered the opening of the city gates and capitulation . The boys barricaded the gates and mounted the city walls , a move probably as much a result of a popular rebellion against Lundy 's action as a defiant gesture . Once the blockade of the river leading into the city was broken by English ships , James and his besiegers lost heart and abandoned the siege . The mythical value of the siege for the construction of protestant -- loyalist hegemony should not be underrated . In his highly condensed and powerful analysis , Buckley ( 1984 ) details how the siege becomes interpreted by today 's protestant loyalists according to a key paradigm mediating their experience of the world . They may be talking about membership of Ulster 's protestant secret societies , particularly the Orange order , the Royal Black Preceptory , and the Apprentice Boys ' Club ; or about religion -- being saved , being a church member , or even a non-practising protestant ; or what appear to them to be key ethical issues such as drink , tobacco , and money ; or they may simply be describing in ordinary everyday language life in the family , on the farm , and in the village . But in all these instances , similar categories of differentiation occur -- the insiders and the outsiders , the religious and the rough , the parent and the child , the female and the male . At one point , the protestants who are involved in violence are rough as opposed to religious , especially if they drink and smoke and do not follow the norms of thrift . Shift the context and the same men become insiders as opposed to outsiders such as catholics and , presumably , even castle catholics . The rough insiders are on the walls , defending God 's true believers from Romanism and immorality . As Buckley points out , it is also the rough who penetrate the virgin city -- the British fleet , breaking the boom across the river to bring food supplies to the stricken protestants within and ensuring the city 's survival and the faithful people 's triumph . One can recognize here , with L�vi-Strauss ( 1968 ) , the importance of ambiguous mediators in relating the opposites within one 's cultural universe and one can add the Apprentice Boys to L�vi-Strauss 's shortlist of tricksters and twins in this role . Despite Buckley 's reluctance to play up the siege of Derry as a key myth and his preference for general categories of interpretation derived from various historical experiences , it does seem that the siege has particular significance . Those who still seek compromise with catholic nationalists today are still known to the erudite leadership of the DUP as Lundies . One should add that Buckley takes the Christian myth for granted , as backdrop to the discourse . But one must remember that the divergent reading of the Christian myth by Reformation and Counter-Reformation is at the heart of the religious as opposed to the rough interpretation of the conflict . The importance of the protestant variant should not be underestimated given the extent of religious practice and the power of religious men within the protestant -- loyalist bloc and the grave importance of conceiving of one 's position as absolutely irreproachable , depending as it does on a divine source . At the heart , or within the innermost wall of the prote
